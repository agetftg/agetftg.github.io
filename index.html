&#39;&#39;Description&#39;&#39;

David is fairly tall, at 6’1”. He’s got brown hair, cut cleanly and a close cropped beard.  His hair is beginning to gray, with his beard graying the most.  He’s quite overweight, with a large belly and obvious man boobs.  They rest on his stomach when he’s sitting down.  He’s fairly hairy all over, and has a mess of pubes crowning his cock like a mane.  He’s got a generous piece of meat, 7” and thick, with big droopy balls to match.  He’s got an S+ dad bod.



&#39;&#39;Personality&#39;&#39;

David is a loving father and a doting husband.  He married Cynthia early, and Alex was born shortly after.  He comes from money, and hasn’t really taken work seriously his whole life.  In his middle age, he’s really let himself go.  He and Cynthia have a rocky relationship, with plenty of highs and lows.  David is fairly certain that Cynthia isn’t the most loyal of wives, and while he pays her attention he’s never felt like he captured it properly.  Depression Is a recurring problem for David, and he’s not sure what to be passionate about in his life.  



&#39;&#39;Kinks and Fetishes&#39;&#39;

David is a relatively vanilla character, however, there’s a few exceptions to the rule.  While he would say, if you were to ask him, that he loves missionary and pleasing his partner above all else; whereas he has a number of kinky thoughts buried deep beneath suburban repression.  He loves oral, and he doesn’t get it enough. It’s never occurred to him, but with a bit of a push he’d become a real freak for piss play.  He would also find this to be the case with sadism.  And he loves the idea of breeding, bundled into his desire to have had more kids.



(text-colour:blue)[[[Play his story...-&gt;Father Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Dog" tags="" position="1306,309" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Description&#39;&#39;

Buck is an old rottweiler.  He’s large for his breed, and was going gray around the muzzle.  He was getting up there in the years. Buck hadn’t been neutered, as he was docile and largely an indoor dog.  His owners objected to anything unnecessarily painful.    



&#39;&#39;Personality&#39;&#39;

He’s always been a loyal and obedient dog.  He learned commands quickly, never barked too much, and was always playful.  He’d try and jump up on anything, and was always on the furniture with his owners.  He&#39;s a very curious dog, always sticking his nose into people&#39;s business.   



&#39;&#39;Kinks and Fetishes&#39;&#39;

Fucks like a dog…  He just wants to get everything pregnant. Dominance and breeding are a part of his nature, as well as his wholesome nature.  Animalistic savagery and loyalty manifest in his actions.  



(text-colour:red)[[[//Play his story...//-&gt;Dog Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Son" tags="" position="2427,439" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Description&#39;&#39;

Alex is a cute young man, well, pretty much still a boy.  He was 5”10, with a little growing still to do.  He was a late bloomer, and didn’t really have much in the way of facial hair outside of a few wisps of translucent blonde hair.  A messy mop of hair, also blonde, sat atop his head.  He’d always gotten compliments from girls in middle and highschool on his hair, and it wasn’t an uncommon occurrence for girls sitting behind him in class to be found playing with his hair.  A golden mane, just ever so curly.  He was lithe and toned, with the body of a swimmer.  Alex is a grower, not a shower much to his chagrin.  His cock is two inches when soft, often retreating inside his body, but a solid and stout four when hard.  Tufts of golden pubes surround his crotch, covering his relatively normal scrotum. 



&#39;&#39;Personality&#39;&#39;

Alex is a shy kid, but plenty sociable once you get him going.  He’s a virgin, but he’s been getting himself off with toys for years now, training his asshole with plugs and dildos.  He’s always been online, and has developed eclectic tastes in porn.  While he hasn’t admitted it to himself yet, he’s bisexual in a bad way.  Currently convinced that he’s training his ass for his future girlfriend and wife, he’s one good push away from fucking anything with legs.  Or getting fucked by.  



&#39;&#39;Kinks and Fetishes&#39;&#39;

 You name it, he’s into it.  Years of surfing the web, masturbation, and creeping interest in the taboo have opened pretty much all doors for Alex’s sexuality.  He spends a lot of time centering around assplay, and he wants to start crossdressing.  At first he thought he wanted to fuck a crossdresser, getting swept up into ‘trap’ porn, but now he’s become obsessed with the idea of trying it himself.  



[[//Play his story.//-&gt;Son - Intro]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Father - Dog" tags="" position="273,435" size="100,100">David was already sexually frustrated before the seed of corruption began to alter him.  It was like an aura grew around him.  He and his wife hadn’t had any relations in six months now.  He’d stopped initiating out of spite from a lack of reciprocal behavior on her part.  She never seemed like she needed satisfying anymore. 

He&#39;d always considered himself open minded, and fantasized about the unobtainable often. Late at night on the couch in his den, David was jerking his cock to some porn on his phone.  He’d recently gone down quite the rabbit hole, looking at a mix of yaoi hentai and gay furry porn.  It didn’t really matter to him what he jerked off to, he just needed something to get the fire going these days.  Something picante and unusual typically did the trick.  

His pants were around his ankles, shirt lifted up.  He had one hand on a nipple, and the other on his cock.  He touched his thick body, imagining himself one of the two big muscly furries having steamy anal sex featured in the piece of artwork he had been viewing.  He’d have to lose some weight and put on some muscle first.  Maybe furries were into dad bods.  An errant thought as he came in big spurts all over the tiled floor in front of the couch.  Taken by surprise by his ejaculation, he laid in a daze, tangled up in his own hands and the pants around his ankles.  Drifting off, he enjoyed a quick post O-snooze.

It was like an aura grew around him.  He and his wife hadn’t had any relations in six months now.  He’d stopped initiating out of spite from a lack of reciprocal behavior on her part.  She never seemed like she needed satisfying anymore.  Knowing that she had to be cheating on him was a hard pill to swallow, but once he had made the connection it became clear to him that maybe she’d been doing it for a long time.  

Snooping through her cloud files, David found a hidden folder deep within some tax documents.  Inside were hundreds of pictures of her.  Each picture was taken the same, a chest and up naked selfie.  Her full motherly breasts on display, the cute paunch at her stomach hidden by the shot.  Blond hair in a chin length bob and bangs that she’d always worn framed her face.  Some had her in ruined makeup, spit running down her lips.  Some had cum plastered on her face or her tits.  All of them had the cock of the man standing behind her jutting over her shoulder.  These were trophy pictures.  

His mind went silent.  In the empty space, white hot rage filled him.  He’d married her, promising to love and cherish her.  They’d raised a child together!  And here was a folder with entries dating back to before they were married.  She’d never stopped.  He turned off his computer, packed his briefcase and left his personal office with a solem determination.  It was time for a confrontation.

Driving home, he thought about what he would do, what he would say.  What could he even say? Was there any coming back from this for their relationship? Feelings of jealousy and anger filled him. She’d never been much of one for sex, always seeming like she didn’t desire it.  Even when they’d been at the peak of their relationship, it had been an infrequent thing for them to make love.  These feelings twisted deep inside him, coiling around the seed planted at the core of his being.  Like vines wrapped around a heart.  Beating and pulsing to the rage coursing through him. 

He stormed into the house, and looked around for Cynthia.  She didn’t appear to be home.  The last place he checked was the master.  Weirdly, the door was closed.  Sounds came from inside.  David threw open the door, knowing what he would find inside.  Cynthia was on the bed, on her stomach, legs in the air.  A stranger was busy pounding her ass, and both their faces were a mix of pleasure and surprise when they saw him stride into the room.  He grabbed the John&#39;s clothes from the floor, thrusting them forward.

She never seemed like she needed satisfying anymore.  He&#39;d always considered himself open minded, and fantasized about the unobtainable often. 

It would be so easy to log into a gay dating app and find someone to give him some quick head.  But he had to stay loyal to his wife, and to his family.  However, when the opportunity arose, he couldn’t help but notice his son.

David had given Alex the birds and the bees talk at a fairly young age.  The usual, you know.  How reproduction worked, how to put on a condom, and how consent worked.  He wanted his son to stay safe and enjoy himself, even if he was maybe a bit too young to actually do that when he gave Alex the talk. Now the boy was older, and off to college at the end of the summer.  But his son asked him if they could sit down and have a conversation.  Alex came out to him as bisexual, and David couldn’t help but smile to himself; thinking of the not so small collection of dildo’s Alex had been ordering off the web, not as conspicuously as the thought, for a while.  

But the opportunity that presented itself to David–set down a path by this seed of corruption–was that his son, during this talk, seemed… turned on?

It was like an aura grew around him.  He and his wife hadn’t had any relations in six months now.  He’d stopped initiating out of spite from a lack of reciprocal behavior on her part.  She never seemed like she needed satisfying anymore.  He&#39;d always considered himself open minded, and fantasized about the unobtainable often.  

Amanda, his son’s tutor, was always around the house.  She came over multiple times to help Kyle prepare for college, but honestly they were just friends. They’d always been friends, ever since Alex and Cynthia had been friends with Amanda’s parents.  She was older now, done with undergraduate and in a post grad program.  She was fairly reserved, except for the purple highlights in her black hair.  Those were new, part of her college experience he was guessing.  She was thin and had an understated body.  But David still had eyes for her regardless.  The young girl he had known, who had babysat Alex and spent time together with had grown into a young woman. He couldn’t help himself.  Fantasizing about her was his dirty secret, and since he wasn’t receiving any attention from his wife he was starting to consider the disloyal. 

Cynthia was throwing a house party for the fourth of July, and David knew that Amanda would be there.  When she came over to the house, she was always there to spend time with Alex.  He hoped that he’d be able to spend a little time with her, and to maybe set some reason to keep seeing her once Alex went off to college.  David and Cynthia practically thought of her as a second child, and with Amanda’s parents no longer living nearby he’d have plenty of excuse to invite her over.  Did she need to do laundry? Or just wanted some space from her roommate? Maye a movie night.  The ideas rolled through David’s head, idily scheming as he set up for the party.  There was so much yard work to be done before then.

(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Tutor 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Father - Dog A" tags="" position="214,701" size="100,100">David was using his new cock whenever he could.  He was having so much fun with his new toy, and he didn’t care that he couldn’t explain it. Retreating into his den at night, he would spend hours stroking his new cock.  Buck would come in and investigate.  He was clearly confused by the presence of a canine member on his master, or at least that’s what David liked to think.  David used a little peanut butter here and there, tempting Buck to give him a lick.  But once it ran out, Buck tended to keep licking.  When David came, he came hard.  Cum would shoot out in ropes for minutes after an orgasm, and he could feel his whole cock pulsing with each rope.  

Peeing was more fun as well, and each time he urinated he almost could feel like a dog marking his territory.  Buck seemed to think so at least.  The dog became more and more subservient, helping David each night in the den.  The stench of cum and urine began to permeate the room.  When they went in there late at night, the arousal was overbearing. Soon, David was lying face up on the floor, and letting Buck lick him to completion.  One night Buck straddled him in reverse, and David had a clear view of Buck’s own red rocket.  One hand reached up, and then two.  Soon both of them were shooting loads, David’s semen being lapped up as it came out on the floor near him and as well as on himself.   Buck’s load mixed in, cum dripping to and pooling on the floor around them.  

The master let the pet lick him clean, grooming him like a fellow animal.  After Buck was done, he stood up and Buck around lapping up remains from their session on the floor. Feeling quite dominant, and inspired by the canine feeling gripping him, he peed on the floor next to Buck.  Piss splashed everywhere, hitting the couch, Buck, and even David himself.  He whistled, and Buck responded.  Buck’s tongue swept through, licking it all up and tasting his master’s fluids. 

A pulse of corruption ripped through the room.  Buck’s tongue elongated and became more dextrous.  A hierarchy had been established.  The dog would now serve his master, pleasuring him with his tongue and cleaning him after.  

Time went on, and David and Buck had their new relationship and new appendages figured out. Every night, and often during the day when they found the time, they’d play as dogs do.  Buck had learned that his master enjoyed tongue in his ass, and would relieve his master’s canine cock of cum and piss at regular intervals during the day.  Sometimes, he’d even come into his master’s bedroom and relieve him at the side of the bed while he laid next to his wife.  David had to keep the changes secret, yet his cock always craved attention.  But nothing beat their alone time in the Den.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Father - Dog B" tags="" position="320,702" size="100,100">That evening, David was investigating his new cock.  Hoping that it would go away, he’d been taking a peak at it all day.  It seemed to work, at least, seeing as he’d gone to the bathroom a number of times.  It was time to see if it worked, well, the other way.  He’d certainly been turned on.  He found himself on the couch in his den, stroking at his new bulbous flesh.  Soon he was lost in pleasure.  No need to feel up his plump body tonight or any need to look at porn.  Both hands were on his dog cock, pumping up and down.  He was leaking precum like crazy, lubing his fingers slick as they traced up and down his meat.  Then he heard a shuffle and a whine on the couch next to him.  He’d been in such a trance, he hadn’t even noticed Buck had come in the room.  

The graying rottweiler was next to him on the couch, facing away and presenting.  An erect cock swung below the mutt’s tight sack.  Buck whined, and turned his head to face David.  Tail wagging, tongue hanging from Buck’s slobbery jaws.  The seed of corruption pulsed, and both in the room were met with growing need.  Could David really take it that far? Before he could think of an answer, he was mounting Buck.  His big, unwieldy body grappled over the top of Buck, his belly and tits pressing down into Buck’s firm body.  His cock slipped through his companion’s legs, almost frotting the two red and pulsing knotted cocks.  Buck licked David’s face, as if giving permission.  David lined up, and thrusted home.  He was pounding, quick and short bursts like a dog.  

The knot popped in, and orgasm stuck like thunder.  It was over in minutes.  David was filled with shame, but also excitement as he rolled off Buck.  But he couldn’t quite pull away. The knot.  David sat there, pumping his load into his bitch’s hole until the knot deflated and he could drag it out

(text-colour:red)[[[//David had to fix things, he loved Buck.//-&gt;Father - Dog B a]]

[[//David eats his shame.//-&gt;Father - Dog B b]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Father - Dog B a" tags="" position="262,814" size="100,100">The desire to see things right, to find a way through this.  Why had this change happened to him? Why was he acting more like a dog than a man? The seed turned.  Corruption filtered into the room.  David left, showered, and got ready to sleep.  He checked on Buck first, finding him asleep in his doggy bed. 

The next morning, Buck woke him, licking his hand.  What a good boy.  He took Buck for a walk around the neighborhood, but noticed something.  Buck wasn’t a good boy anymore, she was a good girl.  Suddenly he could smell her heat.  They rushed home.  Straight into the den they went, David not even bothering to strip.  He unbuttoned and yanked down his pants just enough, and pulled his thick cock out. Striding over, he got his hands around Buck on the couch.  Edge of the couch.  She was whining with need.  He thrust inside, fucking her with renewed fervor.  David knew as he was nearing orgasm that she’d be pregnant after this.  The idea was so hot, it tipped him over the edge.  He gripped, tensing up, as he thrust in. Pop goes the knot.  

A couple months later Buck gave birth to her first litter.  David was such a proud father.  He couldn’t wait to get her pregnant again.  He reached down and pet Buck, letting her know what a good mother she was.  But first, David had to make some calls.  He’d kindled a passion as a dog breeder, and now he had to let his customers know to come take their pick. 


(text-colour:blue)[[[//Revisit David.//-&gt;Father Intro]]]
(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Father - Dog B b" tags="" position="367,813" size="100,100">Something broke inside of David, sitting back on that couch, filled with shame, cum dripping down his dog cock.  How did he get here? Why was his body changing?  What was next?  He looked over, and Buck was there, nuzzling at him and licking his face.  He felt like a monster.  The seed pulsed and grew inside him.  

He looked again at Buck.  He could feel his desire growing.  But he felt a strange desire alongside it.  A desire to eat his shame.  He had to move past this, and accept his new reality as a monster. It would feel so good, wouldn’t it? To just embrace what he’d become, what he’d done.  He sat up off the couch once more, moving over to where Buck waited, presenting, as if he knew his fate.  Atop Buck, David felt his cock against the wet hole at Buck’s backside, still dripping with his cum from earlier.  He slid in.  

But this time he didn’t thrust.  He felt his gut along Buck’s back, felt the presence of life below him.  Pain filled him.  It felt like he was going to split open from the shame.  However, the pain came from a more literal split.  His gut opened, and spilt around Buck.  David felt a struggle underneath him, then crashed into the couch, losing control of his body–and blacked out.

When he woke, his form was different.  He wasn’t really David anymore either.  He was a monster.  A monster that had grown from his experiences with his old pet.  The first change had been subtle, but once he’d accepted the change it had a much more profound effect.  He was seven feet tall now, and his dog cock was much bigger.  Almost a foot long, and quite thick.  Burly and muscular, he was covered from head to toe with a fur coat.  Anthropomorphic extremities, a tail to match.  Better hearing, and a new sense of smell.  He was powerful, a powerful monster.  And he was going to go test his limits.  Who among his old family should he test them against first?

Little did he know, but fate had determined he was in for some change.  A microscopic organism originating from primordial space dust, attached to a meteorite and carried on the winds, had found its way to him.  This organism, this seed, was of a corrupting nature.  Like a burr on a pant leg, this seed latched onto David and buried deep within him.  How would this seed change him? What would it kindle within him? What desires would it stir? Where would he focus this corruption, and his new taboo nature?

Buck, his old buddy, was eagerly lapping up his seed.  The dog was an old rottweiler, and he was as cute as he was intimidating.  The sight brought up a mix of feelings up in David, amusement, intrigue, and something darker.  The seed churned in his chest as a wave of corruption washes over him.   Rock hard, David got up, pants flying toward the couch behind them as he kicked them away.  He went to the mini bar on the side of the room, opened a cabinet, and pulled out a jar of peanut butter he had stashed away for late night hunger pangs.  Back on the couch with a speed unrealistic for a man of his size, he was spreading peanut butter on his cock before common sense could grip him.  Shortly after, Buck had jumped on the couch and was lapping it up off his meat.  Between Buck’s tongue, the reapplication of the peanut butter, and some fondling, David was soon shooting another load.

Buck cleaned up the last of the peanut butter from David’s cock, and then dropped off the couch and lapped up the new load of cum from the floor.  Exhausted and spent, David waddled off in shame to take a shower and get in bed.  Thinking back on his evening, David felt a twitch in his dick as the seed churned again, a wave of corruption spreading through his soul. When he woke the next morning, he was quite surprised to fine that he had changed in the night.  What had once been his large but very normal cock, was now a very large and knotted dog cock.  Huh.

Turning towards his wife, he crouched down to her level.  

“David, I know what this looks like but…” Cynthia began to say, before David cut her off.

“Save it.  I know exactly what this is.  Were you going to take a photo with his cock before or after he finished on your face? Yeah, I know about the folder.  I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me all these years.  Disgusting bitch. I can’t believe I’ve loved you all these years.”

The argument went back and forth, neither moving from their position.  They threw insults at each other, trying to wrest control over the situation and put the other down.  She insinuated that their son, Alex, might not be his because David didn’t get him pregnant fast enough.  Cynthia stood up, her nakedness on full display.  Feelings roiled inside of David.  She tried to push past him, putting her hands on his shoulders and shoving. But she was short and small, and David was big and strong.

“Get out of my way you fat loser.”

David snapped, and shoved back.  Cynthia fell backwards and hit her head on the bed frame with a crack. Time slowed down as he watched her fall, and the seed lurched.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Father - Mother A" tags="" position="4,702" size="100,100">In the days that followed their argument, something between them changed.  Aside from the obvious revelations and venom that sat between them.  Cynthia was scared of David now, and he had a taste of what he felt was a righteous outcome.  But he needed more. Knowing how dependent she was on his wealth, and that in divorce court he would have no trouble winning with the cache of pictures, he knew he had leverage over her.  He was poisoned to their relationship, but if he was stuck with her he might finally get his due, and some revenge.  

First it started with a promise.  She swore that she’d stop fucking around, and redirect her desires towards David.  This would be a humiliating punishment for her, as she clearly despised him and his body.  Servicing his cock every night, she would suck him dry like she hadn’t done in years.  David sometimes let her work at his cock, and sometimes he worked on her with his cock.  He was learning fast that a good face fuck was an excellent way to relieve himself.  

She took it all, and she took it weirdly without complaint.  Diminutive is the only thing that could properly describe what was left of her will.  It was almost like she was a maid, or a slave to him.  He’d wrapped a chain around her neck, and he wanted to tighten it.  That white hot rage had never really abated, even with their arrangement.  So he began to test the limits.  

(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Mother A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Father - Mother B" tags="" position="107,701" size="100,100">David’s eyes went wide.  Cynthia was on the ground.  He paced around the room, panicking.  Fuck.  What was going to happen to him?  Was she okay?  He breathed in, and stopped for a minute.  First, check her pulse.  She’s breathing.  He stroked her face, thinking manically that she was just fucking with him.  He’d show her.  A quick unzip of his pants and a couple pumps later, he had his cock at her lips.  Leaning her against the bed, face at a receiving angle on the edge of the mattress, he entered her mouth.  She drooled around his cock, not moving outside of the force of his motions.   

The seed within David hummed to life as he committed this terrible act.  The corruption coalesced, and as he shot his load down Cynthia’s helpless throat, that corruption swept along it.  His seed carried yet another seed, the beginnings of a corrupt and beautiful garden.  David pulled his cock free, wiping it on her cheek.  Some of his load dribbled out of her mouth along with the stream of saliva.  He left the room to go and tell his son Alex that his mother had left town to go visit her parents for the week.  

When he came back that night, she was still in the same position, slack against the bed.  Her mouth was open and waiting.  He raped her mouth again, that warm wet hole that was at perfect dick height for him.  She wasn’t complaining.  Crawling into bed on the other side, he turned out the lights and went to sleep.  

(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Mother B 2]]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Father - Mother B 2" tags="" position="109,816" size="100,100">This continued for a number of days, and David never once worried about Cynthia again.  She was clearly brain dead, and without help she would likely die soon.  But that didn’t stop David.  He kept using her mouth, pumping loads down her throat.  He liked to think he was watering his favorite plant.  On the fourth day, he noticed something.  Roots were growing from her arms and legs, motionless against the floor and bed.  The tendrils traveled into the floor, where they had broken through and found a pipe.  

On the fifth day, more changes had taken place.  Blond hair and an open mouth had been replaced with what looked like an exotic fleshy plant.  Closed like a bud, it opened into four fleshy petals at the faintest of touch.  Inside was a canal filled with tongue-like appendages.  Observing her body below this erotic and perverse plant, he saw evidence of the body being consumed.  Leaves were beginning to sprout from her skin as if they were hair follicles.  The best thing was the smell though.  Nothing like death or rotting, but the most erotic smell David thought might be possible.  He couldn’t describe it, but it reminded him of Cynthia, and their happy days.  David probed the bud’s canal with his cock.  It was time to fertilize this plant.  He wondered idly as he slid in what kind of corrupted fruit it would grow.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//Revisit David.//-&gt;Father Intro]]]
(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Father - Mother A 2" tags="" position="2,815" size="100,100">Every session was followed by a treat.  First it was candy, then cake, then pie.  Cynthia seemed quite receptive to following orders.  Even if she said she was full and didn’t want to eat any more that day or evening, she’d relent and ‘treat herself’ for each act.  Then David expanded the parameters of what he made her do for him.  He started by cumming on her face instead of down her throat, and then on her clothes or in her hair. Anything that would ruin her look or her clothes.  

Then he started changing up the frequencies of these trysts.  Soon he was blowing a load in or on her multiple times a day.  Each release was followed by a feeding.  David was training her like a dog.  He truly had begun to relish this abuse.  Scheming new ways to use and abuse her for his pleasure, David spent his idle time thinking and planning.  How could he really humiliate her? How could he ruin her?  She deserved it so fucking bad, and he wanted to make a big push with Cynthia.  It had been months since the fight, and while she was following along with his actions, it was time to fully destroy her.

When he returned home that day, he found her in the living room, doing yoga.  She was trying to keep the weight from the sweet treats from sticking to her figure, as motherly as it was.  Sitting on the couch in the room, he placed down a number of brown paper bags next to him and patted his thigh.  She stopped her pose, and moved over to kneel by the couch.  He could see her tits behind the sports bra, and her ass squishing against her legs underneath her.  Cynthia quickly got to work, unzipping his fly and then unclasping his belt.  

(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Mother A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Father - Mother A 3" tags="" position="0,927" size="100,100">She pulled his seven inches out, and started working on it with her mouth.  Tongue worked the head as she worked her lips further and further down.  She gripped at the base of his cock and pumped up and down, working him to full hardness.  Her head bounced up and down, her brow hitting against his gut.  David put a hand on the back of her head and pushed her all the way down.  Nose in his pubes, he could feel her labored breathing.  He ran his hands through her golden bangs, and told her she was such a bad girl.  He leaned back, and let her do her work.

As soon as he was nearing orgasm, he grabbed her hair and yanked her into his pubis. He released, and more cum than he knew he had ever produced in his life splattered down her throat.  Today, he wasn’t going to waste it on her clothes or on her face.  For what felt like minutes, he pumped his load down her bruised and sore throat.  Releasing her, she came up gasping for air.  Moving her hands to her hair, she attempted to fix her appearance, and then resumed a waiting position at his feet.  

David turned to his side and grabbed the brown paper bags.  Emptying them on the floor in front of him, a cornucopia of fast food tumbled out.  Multiple burgers, chicken nuggets, fries, you name it.  

“Eat.” he demanded, issuing the single command.

She looked terrified, it was simply too much food for her.  She had always been indulgent, but even this was too much.  She’d be bursting from the lot of it.  But she felt compelled to go through with this.  Surely he’d stop torturing her eventually? Undoing the wrapper from a burger, she looked up at him in an attempt at defiance but she knew she’d be eating it all even if she had to sit there for an hour working it down.

Four burgers, a pile of fries and nuggets later, she coughed and burped and threw down the last half eaten food.  She was so thirsty from the salt and the fat, but she knew she didn’t dare try and fit anything else down her gullet.  

(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Mother A 4]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Father - Mother A 4" tags="" position="1,1037" size="100,100">“Don’t forget the desert.” David said, pointing to his flaccid cock.

Enough time had passed that he was probably ready for another go around.  She didn’t know how she’d be able to keep that food down while getting throat fucked roughly a second time.   Why did she continue to obey this man and live under his tyranny? It clearly wasn’t worth living the lifestyle she’d become accustomed to.  Or letting Alex know what a terrible mother she’d been.  Shame filled her as she took his cock in her mouth.  She reached her hands up to cup his balls and coax him back to hardness when he stopped her hands.

Grabbing her jaw with one hand and Cynthia’s hands with the other, he closed his eyes.  He could feel his cock head in her warm and wet mouth.  Closing his eyes, he thought of the car parked in the garage.  In the passenger seat sat four empty soda to go cups, and with that thought came the terrible need to release.  He’d been holding it in, waiting for Cynthia to finish up eating.  A heavy stream of piss erupted from his penis, straight down her gullet. She struggled at first, but with her hands tied up in one his stronger ones, and his other hand on her jaw, she soon stopped.  It only took a minute, but he emptied his bladder straight into her.  Gagging and spitting, she came up off his cock in a much more distressed state this time.  

Standing up and moving away from him, she coughed and hacked.  Closing her mouth and placing her hand over her lips, she heaved.  Clearly fighting her body&#39;s attempt to throw up, she groaned.  That was when David noticed her stomach.  It was bloated, and rounded, as if she were pregnant.  He’d stuffed her silly, turning her mouth and body into a cum dump and a toilet.  She looked at him, plainly worried for her future.  What an excellent afternoon.  

Months went by, and her nature became more and more docile and subservient.  She took her feedings every day, and David stuffed her as often as she could take it.  Weight began to show on her body.  Her appearance became more and more disheveled as the effect of being a living toilet for her spouse weighed on her.  Plus, she didn’t need to look good to attract local boys on dating apps anymore.  So soon her self-care routine evaporated.  She’d already found a replacement for it. A year passed, and Cynthia had retreated inside of herself as her body continued to grow.


(text-colour:blue)[[[//Revisit David.//-&gt;Father Intro]]]
(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Father - Son A" tags="" position="480,569" size="100,100">David sprung forward, one hand around Alex’s jaw, and leaned in to kiss him.  It was a wet and sloppy kiss, and he shoved his tongue in Alex’s mouth.  His other hand went to his son’s arm, and he squeezed it passionately.  They broke off the kiss, and Alex was panting.

“What was that? I don’t… I mean” Alex managed to mumble out.  

David moved his hand down from Alex’s face, to his thigh.  Bringing his hand over, he found purchase on Alex’s crotch. 

“You don’t have to say anything, I can feel how you think right here. Isn’t this what you want?” David growled.  

Alex almost whined, and then pressed back into his father’s embrace.  It was apparent that David’s gamble had worked and he was going to get laid, and still stay loyal to his family.  Certainly a perversion of that promise, but David didn’t care.  The perversion of the moment was rushing through his veins, and pooling in his cock.  

They hurried to Alex’s bedroom, ripping off eachother’s clothes as soon as the door was closed.  Cynthia wouldn’t be home until later tonight.  David pulled open the chest of drawers where he knew Alex had hidden his collection of toys, and grabbed the lube.  Alex smiled at him, smirking in acknowledgement.  Children always think they’re getting away with whatever they’re hiding from their parents.  David walked to the bed, groping his son by the ass.  They were naked in front of each other for the first time, and drinking in eachother’s bodies.  They were both drunk on the lust. Alex stared at David’s cock, hanging and pulsing beneath his gut.  Alex brought one hand to David’s shoulder, and the other rested on David’s stomach.  Both of David&#39;s hands were on his son’s ass cheeks, pulling and kneading them.  Their cocks touched, rubbing against each other.  David was much larger than his son, seven inches versus four.  David couldn’t wait to tuck into his son’s lithe swimmers body. A bead of his precum strung between their cocks, both blisteringly hard.   

(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Son A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Father - Son B" tags="" position="630,567" size="100,100">“This is for you, Alex.  I snooped on your computer a while back, after finding a toy you left out in your bathroom. I wanted to make sure I knew what was going on in your life, and to make sure you were doing things safely and securely.  I didn’t like snooping, but I had to do it as your parent.  I want you to buy yourself something nice off your wishlist.  I know you’ve got a lot of things stored there.  Consider it a congratulatory gift for coming out.”

Alex leaned forward and kissed his dad on the cheek.  Squeezing his hand, David knew he’d done right by his son and pushed his affections.  Leaving Alex to his business, David went on with his day.

Some time later, David saw some packages he hadn’t ordered be delivered to the front door.  Bringing them inside, lest porch bandits get to them, David saw they were marked for Alex.  Placing them on his bed, David smiled and wondered what his son had ended up ordering.  Was it more toys? Something to fuck instead of something to fuck himself with? Or perhaps it was some risque lingerie that David had spied shortly before exiting out of the browser in surprise.  Deep in his core the seed lurched.  David sure would like to see his son in some of those item’s he’d gotten a glimpse at.

Later that night after a nice and filling dinner, David was watching TV alone on the couch in the main room, patting his stomach contentedly.  He heard a rustling coming down the stairs, and idly wondered if Cynthia would possibly join him for the rest of the evening.  Fat chance of that, she was probably out fucking some stranger for all he knew.  She was hardly around these days.  Turning to look, he saw his son.  From what he was wearing, it may as well have been his daughter.  

(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Son B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Father - Son A 2" tags="" position="478,701" size="100,100">While he was enjoying the moment, David felt compelled to take things further.  He turned Alex around, and pushed him onto the bed.  Landing with his ass up in the air, Alex turned his head around to see David place a firm hand on his back, pressing him into the bed.  Opening the tube with his teeth, David squeezed a fat glob onto David’s ass.  He ran a finger through it, taking enough to spread over his cock.  Bringing his hand back, he gently spread it around his son’s hole.


“You’re going to enjoy this.  Careful, it might feel a bit cold” he said, punctuating his sentence with a press of his index finger.  

Flat against the opening and angling down from the top, he applied just enough pressure to work the tip of his finger through.  Resistance from Alex’s anal walls was brief, as he relaxed to the feeling of invasion.  Moving deep and then back out, repeating the motion, David was satisfied Alex was ready.  Bringing the last of the lube to his cock, refreshing it with a few pumps, he brought his weapon to bear.  

He pressed in, feeling his head push through the opening of Alex’s tight ass.  His boy felt so good to be in.  Sliding all the way in, pushing his seven inches of thick meat into Alex’s hole, his gut rested on the small of Alex’s back.  Leaning down, breathed down the back of his prey.  His free hand snaked underneath the trembling body beneath him and found the cute cock hanging there.  

“I hope you’re ready for this. I’m not going to hold back.  It’s a good thing you’ve been training this hole of yours.” David growled into his son’s ear.

If you were standing outside the door to this room listening in, you’d be treated to a feast of wet plaps and grunts. Minutes into the affair, you’d have heard a cute moan as Alex blew his load on the Duvet beneath him.  Now with both hands free, David had taken up his son&#39;s hips and was plugging away with his thick cock.  The fuck lasted almost half an hour.  Alex, groaning towards the end of the session, had another orgasm.  This one was from his prostate getting absolutely beamed by his dad’s enthusiastic thrusting.  

(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Son A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Father - Son A 3" tags="" position="480,813" size="100,100">If you were standing outside the door to this room listening in, you’d be treated to a feast of wet plaps and grunts.

Alex, groaning towards the end of the session, had another orgasm.  This one was from his prostate getting absolutely beamed by his dad’s enthusiastic thrusting.  

David was pretty much out of breath by the time his orgasm approached.  Alex could feel it coming on by the increase in pace of the fucking. Looking back at his father, Alex smiled and said 

“I want you to come inside me dad. Come so much my ass gets pregnant.”

Slamming home, David was overcome by the stimulation and the words.  The seed of corruption lurched deep within him, and his jism shot out in thick ropes into the waiting hole.  David didn’t know it yet, but his son’s half joked wish was going to come true.

Collapsing on the bed, they looked into each other’s eyes.  They laughed, and David planted a kiss on his son’s face.  Slapping his belly, he sat up and pointed towards the bathroom.  

“Gotta take a piss, son. I’ll be right back.”

(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Son A 4]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Father - Son A 4" tags="" position="481,920" size="100,100">Reaching for his now flaccid cock underneath his hanging belly, he aimed at the toilet.  Alex came in behind him, reaching both hands towards David’s cock and taking it out of his hands.  David released, and the strong stream of piss left his dick towards the toilet bowl.  With the stream trickling out, David turned around to face his son.  But Alex was crouching now, partially hidden from sight beneath David’s corpulent stomach.  Suddenly David felt Alex’s mouth on his johnson, cleaning with care the traces of cum, piss, and lube.  David smiled, and knew he was in for a treat with his son.


They fucked like rabbits in the coming weeks, working elements of piss play into their sessions.  Sometimes David would stop by Alex’s room just to piss, at first assisted at the toilet, and then Alex became the toilet.  Nothing could beat a couple of cold beers in the evening before dinner, and then pissing them straight out into his son’s mouth afterwards.  They fucked at least every night, often in his marital bed as Cynthia was never around. Eventually Alex started to put on weight.  He looked bloated, especially around the midriff.  But it was different from the usual male weight gain. Centered around the pubis, it almost looked as if Alex was pregnant.  The seed lurched again within David.   

Months after their first fuck, and just before Alex was due to head off to college, the denial cleared up and David knew what had happened.  Alex put in for a gap year with his University.  Taking his son’s hand in his own, he promised Alex the same David had promised his mother when they’d gotten married after a sudden pregnancy.  He’d always take care of him, and the child.  This time though, David swore he’d not let his relationship fail.  And he’d have more than one child this time.  David knew there’d be no chance for Alex to leave for school after the first birth, because David would be keeping him pregnant for a long time to come.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Father - Son B 2" tags="" position="631,700" size="100,100">“I wanted to show you what I ordered from the web using that giftcard, Dad… What do you think?” Alex said, surprisingly confidently.

Inspecting from head down to toe, David took in the sight of his son.  Noticing eyeliner and some eyeshadow, a touch of lip gloss on his mouth, and a thin black choker around his neck.  Below that, a sheer and strappy black bra laid flat against his son’s chest.  Below, at his thin midriff, a black garter belt sat cinched around his waist.  Sheer black panties, he judged in a cheeky cut, held his small but fiercely hard bulge in check.  The garters fed down towards shiny and, again, sheer black thigh highs. Stilettos graced his feet, an open style of heel with a strap around his ankles.  The suite of lingerie and accessories complimented his thin and supple body, any thin blond hairs that might have been noticeable otherwise shaved away.  Alex sauntered forward, showing mastery over the heels and a burgeoning confidence.  

“I wanted to thank you for being such a great dad, and for embracing who I am with such grace and kindness. I know you and mom don’t really, well, let’s just say I haven’t heard anything fun coming from your bedroom in a long while. So, basically, what I’m saying is… I guess, I want to maybe take her place?” Alex rambled.


The corruption lurched once more within David.  Suddenly he felt under dressed, in his evening tee and shorts.  Compared to such a burgeoning beauty.  He had to have her.  A replacement for Cynthia, yes.  That would do.  He thought wickedly about spending money on Alex like an escort.  Alexis? Yes, that would be her new name.  They’d always considered it, if Alex had been born a woman.  God, what he would give to have those lips wrapped around his cock.  He’d never been this hard in his life.  

“Come here” David said gruffly.

(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Son B 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Father - Son B 3" tags="" position="628,807" size="100,100">Alex moved forward timidly, not sure the direction this was going to go. If only he knew.  David pulled Alex down to him on the couch, and hooked a thumb into the elastic band of his pants.  

“Suck me while I admire your outfit, and I might buy you another one.” he said crassly.  

This behavior surprised both of them.  Alex didn’t waste time, however.  Fondling his father at first, he was soon off with a gusto, slobbering over the top three inches of his Dad’s thick and swollen cock.  David drank in the scene, and was soon approaching orgasm.  He’d never had head like this, and he’d at least not had any kind of head in a while. This might be the best thing he’d ever experienced.  
The lust was too much. His own son, dressed in terribly naughty lingerie, was scarfing down his meat like a marooned sailor on a desert island enjoying his last ration.  David’s orgasm was sudden, and forceful. Taking a shot down his throat, Alex jerked his head off the cock and took a second, third, and fourth shot to the face while coughing up the first.  Alex was grinning though.  

“We’re going to work on that.  Next time let’s try getting a few more inches down that throat of yours.  But you certainly know how to make a first impression.  I think I’ll be calling you Alexis, now that we’ve been properly introduced.  What a good girl, you really know how to treat your father.”

Alex smiled, and drew up.  Precum leaking into his panties, he sauntered away from the couch.  


“I look forward to seeing what you order me, Daddy.” He said, at the base of the stairs before disappearing up them. 

Alexis was certainly up for some new outfits after a performance like that, and David couldn’t wait to see how their relationship continued to change and evolve.  The seed of corruption inside David fed his lust as it lurched once again.

After a few weeks, Alexis was quite the cock sucker.  She took it like a champ, and took loads like a champ.  Down her throat, on her face, in her mouth, or on her lingerie.  Wherever David wanted to paint, he painted.  

She was also getting better at her makeup, her hair growing longer.  She was becoming quite the woman.  Soon Alexis abandoned all her boy clothes, and let David take her shopping at a couple nice boutiques.  Effectively his mistress, she had to look the part.  Soon he’d have her cooking his meals as well, and sleeping in his bed.  She’d need some new good cookware in the kitchen, and maybe they could redecorate.  After the divorce went through and Cynthia moved out.  David loved spending money on Alexis, almost as much as how he loved how good she sucked his cock dry every night.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Father - Son B b" tags="" position="688,920" size="100,100">Alexis was really getting into the swing of things, taking David deep and keeping suction tight on his cock.  Never a hint of teeth.  Always wet and warm.  David came deep inside her mouth.  There was never any mutual pleasure though, and he didn’t have any interest in any more than her mouth.  As the focal point of this corruption, and the focal point of their activities, Alexis’ mouth began to change. It didn’t matter if Alexis put on make up, it would just run down her face.  Her outfits didn’t matter, because all he looked at was her lips on his cock.  They settled into a rhythm focused purely on pleasure.

But David wanted somewhere, deep inside of him, for Alexis to feel some pleasure.  He was a generous and giving type.  Slowly, Alexis’ mouth began to change.  Her tongue became longer, her lips more plump.  Her moist and warm mouth somehow became wetter and more inviting.  It was like her mouth was a pussy.  And soon after the thought came to David, Alexis began to really start moaning–not just for show.  

The first time Alexis came from her mouth, the pressure on David’s meat was so much that he couldn’t help but match her orgasm.  Her dexterous tongue, now both a tool for David’s pleasure and effectively a clit for her mouth pussy, tightened like a noose around his head as she slammed deep into his pubis.  She didn’t mind the pubes poking her face anymore, if anything, it just gave her more pleasure through the contact with her lips.  Cum hit the back of her throat, and her mind went blank with pleasure.  David knew he had changed his child permanently, and all he could think of was how much he was looking forward to the next load he could shoot down this greedy snatch.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Father - Tutor 2" tags="" position="855,564" size="100,100">The day of the party came, and David spent his time at the grill in the backyard.  He was flipping brats, burgers, you name it.  Cynthia might not pay him much attention, but she knew how to throw a party and he knew how to grill out and drink beer.  It was a lovely time.  People milled through the backyard and the house, plenty of people stopping to talk to him and keep his mind occupied as he cooked out.  He spied Amanda a couple times out by the pool, she was talking with a neighborhood couple.  She had her hair done up nicely, a crown braid ending in a ponytail that highlighted her purple streaks nicely.  Her skin was fair, yet carrying a summer tan.  She wore a skintight pair of jeans, highrise up to her midriff, and a cute floral tube top.  The sight of her lithe stomach made him stop and stutter in the middle of his sentence. He almost dropped the brat in his tongs at the visual.  She turned and smiled at him.  

The party went on, and as dusk took the backyard, tiki torches were lit and the good booze was brought out.  The crowd had thinned, and now it was just close family.  David was sitting on a poolside chair, when Amanda came over and sat on his lap.  She leaned in and raised her glass to Davids.

“Cheers, and thanks for the wonderful party.  You’re the best, David.”
Blushing, he clinked her glass back and downed his reposado.  She stood up and walked into the house.  Turning to him as she stood in the doorway, Amanda winked at him, and went inside.  A few minutes later, David excused himself from the circle of conversation outside, he went indoors.  Searching through the house, he finally found Amanda in the guest bedroom.  They had deposited the guests jacket’s and things on the bed there.  Amanda was sorting through her purse when he came into the room. 

(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Tutor 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Father - Tutor 3" tags="" position="858,702" size="100,100">Fishing something out of her purse, she turned to David and smiled.  

“I was wondering if you’d follow me inside, and I knew I had something I needed in here.” She said, holding up a condom. 

“Come with me.” She said, following up with her hand outstretched.

Dumbstruck, David took her hand and followed them upstairs to the master bedroom.  Inside, she slipped off her tube top, revealing her small but perky tits.  He reached a hand forward and grabbed a handful.  She chuckled, and held her hand to his against her breast.  

“You don’t know how long I’ve wanted this.  I’ve been admiring you for years, David. You’re just my type.  I’ve always been into older men, and I know you’re safe and I can trust you.  Let’s have some fun tonight, okay?”

David was completely flabbergasted.  Breaking into a smile to match hers, he gave her a nod of acknowledgement.  He looked down at himself and frowned though. Did he really believe that she was into his girthy body? Confusion and doubt multiplied in his head.  

(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Father - Tutor 4]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Father - Tutor 4" tags="" position="859,810" size="100,100">Sensing his doubt, she raised a hand to his chin and lifted his face up to hers.

“Don’t be nervous.  I meant what I said. I want you as you are.” 

She moved her hands to his shirt and began to unbutton it.  Taking it all the way off of him, she drank in the sight of his dad bod.  A distended tummy, man tits sitting atop, and a rug of hair.  She looked ecstatic.  She reached into the tiny little pocket sewn into her high rise jeans and brought out a vape.  She took a hit, and giggled.  

“Here, try this.  Alex and I smoke this all the time together. You’ll like it.”

David breathed in on the vape, and held in the smoke as long as he could.  It was cute that she thought he’d not know what weed was or how to smoke it.  Breathing the cloud into her face in a slow and playful manner, he reached forward and unbuttoned the top of her jeans.  Hooking a thumb into the jeans, David slid them down.  No panties, nice.  A hand went to her pussy, and cupped it, a finger sliding along her slit.  She was wet already.  Amanda worked on his pants at the same time.  She pulled them and his boxers down in one go to the middle of his thigh, watching impressed as his seven inches of cockmeat sprang foward.  Amanda couldn’t wait to bounce on that toy.  

They went to the bed, and Amanda told him to lie back.  She slid forward as he laid down, and climbed on top of him.  The condom lay forgotten in the pile of clothes on the floor.  Both were too crossfaded to remember it.  Their moans twined together as the sounds of him riding his cock went into the night. The seed of corruption inside David thrummed with life, and by morning Amanda would be changed the corruption present in his seed. 

(text-colour:lime)[[[//Amanda got pregnant that summer night.//-&gt;Father - Tutor A]]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Father - Tutor A" tags="" position="802,919" size="100,100">Groaning at the idea of the forgotten condom, David had cleaned up the bedsheets and organized the room that morning.  She’d snuck out at dawn.  David didn’t even care that Cynthia hadn’t been there that night to find them cheating.  He had better get to cleaning up the rest of the party.  

Amanda and David got together many times in the following weeks.  This time, they used protection.  Amanda was insatiable, and had a hair trigger.  She would come on his dick three or four times before he was even near his own orgasm.  When he got close, she’d get off his dick and remove the rubber, finishing the job with her mouth.  She took each load down her throat, and loved it every time. They often met up for drinks at a bar, or at a restaurant for food before they went back to his or hers to fuck.  She always had the perfect cute or sultry outfit on. And they always hit the vape, because who doesn’t love sex while high.  David was fully enchanted, and it made him feel young and good again. Confidence grew in him as they continued to meet.

Eventually Alex had gone off to college, and Amanda started showing.  She’d suspected that she was pregnant when she missed her period and a test had confirmed it.  But David asked her to keep it, promising to take care of the both of them.  He was flush with cash, and he could afford a family on the side no problem.  She’d have to drop out of her program, but it would just be a temporary thing.  They stopped using condoms as she was already as pregnant as she could get, and she took his seed whenever she could.  In her pussy, in her ass, in her mouth.  She could never get enough.  

As they continued their rendezvous, and as Amanda continued to grow his child inside of her, her body started changing.  But he wasn’t convinced that it was just the pregnancy.  Her lips plumped up, her hips widened.  And her tits, oh her tits.  They jumped from an A to a B cup, then a C cup, and onwards.  By the time she was ready to give birth to his offspring, not only was she sporting a near E cup on her still fairly slim band size, but she had a completely different figure. She looked like a doll, like his doll.  And he liked to play with his toys. 

After their daughter was born, things went back to normal.  Dinner, drinks, dates, vapes were back on the menu.  But this time around they wouldn’t be bothering with protection ever again.  She was too addicted to the lifestyle and to the changes her pregnancy brought on.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Father - Tutor B" tags="" position="914,916" size="100,100">The next few times they got together, it became clear to David what was happening.  He didn’t know how, or why, but he knew she was getting high off his cock and cum.  She’d take a load from him, and then she’d be acting off for hours after.  But as much as it troubled him, he knew he wouldn’t stop seeing her. She was too perfect for him, too willing, too young and pretty.

She was the perfect girlfriend.  She let him spoil her, David was always bringing over gifts, giving her cash to go shopping.  Amanda always sucked him, rode him, and gave him the love and intimacy he’d lost out on over the years.  He loved when she laughed, or when she ran her hand through her hair, letting the purple and black locks fall over her shoulders.  He was in love, he guessed.  They hoped things could stay like this forever, whispering how much they were enjoying each other&#39;s company as adults as they cuddled in bed.  

But Amanda after they had sex was another matter.  She was ravenous, she was slutty, but she was duller.  It was like there was less of her there, when she was high on his load.  He tried wearing a condom, even attempted faking to stave off those post sex binges.  But she wanted his cum so badly, and she even when sober wouldn’t let him off the hook without pumping at least a couple loads into her.  

Soon David noticed that the pleas became more desperate, and the high lasted longer.  They’d fuck, and she’d be strung out for the rest of the day.  David cherished those now brief periods of contact with the real Amanda, but it was doomed.  One afternoon, a few months after they started fucking around, David found her in her apartment still high off the previous day’s loads. She was on her bed, half clothed.  Smiling and giggling, she opened her legs, presenting her swollen pussy. 

“Fuck me high, please daddy.  My pussy needs your cum. Fuck me so hard that I’m never sober again. I want to OD on your dick so fucking bad…” she slurred out.  

Might as well oblige, he thought.   Her pussy was too good.  He’d fuck the last of that bright girl he’d fallen for at the party right out of her.

Little did the dog know, but fate had determined he was in for some change.  A microscopic organism originating from primordial space dust, attached to a meteorite and carried on the winds, had found its way to him.  This organism, this seed, was of a corrupting nature.  Like a burr on a pant leg, this seed latched onto Buck and buried deep within him. As a lower life form, it wrested control straight away.  Playing to the baser instincts of an animal, it was able to twist Buck quickly.  Only a little stimuli would send this loyal and playful dog down a dark path.  Where would he focus his attention?

These trips were very enjoyable for Buck, he liked to run around in the water and find things to dig up in the sand.  David always smelt apprehensive and nervous at the beach, so Buck figured he was brought along to support him.  David didn’t want to take his shirt off at the beach because he was embarrassed about his body.  He’d gotten old, and let himself go.  With so many young and attractive people there, he felt terribly self conscious.  

There was a cute lifeguard who often was working at the beach during the times they would visit, a young woman Alex&#39;s age.  She was fairly tall, with a large bosom and wide hips.  David was still bigger though, his bulk was impressive for a human.  His brown hair, even if graying, matched hers.  She always had it tied up in a ponytail, highlighting her cold blue eyes.  Buck loved her smell, ripe and ready.  David would make awkward chit chat with her, and she would encourage him to enjoy life and get in the water.  He was a cute old dog, so that earned them bonus points with her.  Over time Buck could tell they were bonding, and he could smell the arousal on both of them.  Buck, in his new state, wanted to take advantage of this.   
 
One day David finally summons up the courage, and takes his shirt off to go in the water, leaving Buck with the young lifeguard.  On his way back in from the water, she handed him his towel, shirt, and her number folded into the bundle.  Her name was Sarah.  David put the number in his phone, but didn’t call it.  Buck nosed at David’s hand whenever he had it palmed, hoping to encourage him.  David was actively considering cheating on his wife, as she was almost certainly cheating on him, and Sarah was a cute young thing.  

(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Dog - Father 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Dog - Mother" tags="" position="1297,575" size="100,100">Buck never had much loyalty for his female owner, Cynthia.  He always had a much better relationship with his male owners, David and his son Alex.  Was she really part of the pack?  She always smelled different than the rest of those in the house.  Even Amanda, the human who frequently came over to visit Alex smelled more… right.  After his alteration, Buck began a campaign to eschew this unfitting female from their home.  

Buck only had a few tools at his disposal as a dog, but he used them to great effect.  Those nice heels that Cynthia seemed to favor on her nights out?  A perfect attack target, for practice when his humans needed him to protect them.  A low drawer in her boudoir left open? Perfect place to urinate.  A favorite dildo, left out on the nightstand? Buck’s new favorite chew toy that he kept buried safely in the backyard.  

Cynthia knew that Buck was running this campaign against her, and she fought back.  Treats were thrown away, his bed was downgraded to something less comfortable, and a shock module was put on his collar.  Every time she would find he had done something bad, he’d receive a shock.  These behaviors continued back and forth, until one afternoon Buck found her in the master bedroom, riding the cock of an actual stranger.

This was a common occurrence as Alex was reaching maturity.  Nosing open the door, Buck found Alex on his bed playing with his ass.  Alex was a cute young human, with a lithe and fairly hairless body, except for the mop of blonde hair on his head.  The boy was shoving a fake cock into his ass, face down on his knees, ass in the air.  At a closer inspection, the room smelled of plastic as well, both in the fluid on Alex’s hole and the instrument he was using inside of him. 

Buck jumped on the bed, and began licking at Alex.  Maybe he was trying to get something out? Or to get rid of that plastic-y smelling stuff.  Alex shoved him off, telling him to get down.  NOrmally he’d oblige, but he didn’t this time.  He continued persistently, and kept interrupting Alex’s thrusting.  He lapped at Alex&#39;s fingers and the toy Alex was playing with, attempting to clean them or help Alex with whatever he was doing.  Buck was frustrated at Alex not wanting to play! 

Finally Alex relented and let Buck lap at his ass. Buck drove his tongue deep into the lubed cavity.  The boy was moaning, overstimulated by his play with the toy and now his dog&#39;s tongue. Alex’s cock swung between his legs, swollen and needing attention.  Alex moved a hand to it, since he no longer needed both for his ass.  Buck himself was quite turned on at this point, his knotted cock escaping its sheath.  He brought his tongue out from Alex’s ass, and mounted atop Alex, his cock bouncing off the boy’s ass.  

Alex grabbed Bucks red and hard cock, guiding it into his needy hole.  He was completely overcome by this situation, and by the aura radiating from Buck.  Good decision making was a thing of the past for Alex.  Right now, he needed a load deep in his ass pussy.  Buck rutted hard and fast, Alex pumping his cock to Buck’s thrusts.  Overwhelmed, both exploded, cum making a mess of Alex’s insides and his bed cover.  

Buck unmounted Alex, with his knot still tied inside and pumping away, delivering his cum deep inside the boy.  Buck wagged his tail, yipping at his companion.  Alex smiled, and reached back from his position tummy down on the bed to pet Buck.  Alex was hooked, and Buck knew it.  He would use Alex up, like a new toy or a bone to chew on.

She’d always been around, but recently after going away for a number of years, she was back.  This was exciting for Buck, even if it took a few visits to relearn her smell.  She smelled a bit different after those years away.  Amanda could remember when Buck was just a pup, of course, and she’d always been a kind human.  Now that Buck was getting old, it was good to be reunited with a figure from his youth.  That, and she liked to treat him when she came over.  Bones, toys, you name it.  And she was always down to play.  He’d jump up at her the moment she was in the door.  

But there was something else to their relationship.  When Amanda was still a teenager and over to visit with her family (her family came over often to visit his owners back in the day), she would always make time for Buck.  They’d sneak away, and he would smell her intent.  She was needy, and Buck had a long tongue.  She loved getting her pussy ate, and Buck had been doing a great job of it for almost a decade. Part of the reason she’d agreed to come tutor Alex was the opportunity to spend some time with Buck. None of the boys or girls at college ate pussy the same way Buck did.  

Buck could tell that Amanda was stressed the first time she came over to tutor Alex, and while he didn’t know she&#39;d dropped out of her graduate program, he knew that she’d use his tongue to make herself feel better.  He waited outside Alex’s room, as the door had been closed while the two of them were working. Eventually she came out, petted him on the head, and led him to the bathroom.  

Amanda was slipping out her sundress as soon as the door was closed.  Buck thought she had a good body, great for running. It was more compact than Cynthia’s, but she was toned and had good long legs.  Squatting there on the floor of the hallway bathroom, she pulled her thong aside.

(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Dog - Tutor 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Dog - Father 2" tags="" position="1090,699" size="100,100">They met up in a hotel room, David wanted to spare no expense.  Sarah sent a picture of what she was going to wear underneath her clothes to the hotel.  It was a cute little black lingerie bodysuit.  David was excited.  Weirdly, she told him to bring Buck.  David didn’t mind though.  They arrived, and David found her already there, on the bed, made up and wearing only the little number.  

David walked up to the side of the bed, and she scooted up to the edge.  She had her hands on his pants, undoing his belt and unzipping his fly.  She popped the button, and out came his cock.  She took his balls in her hand, and licked the tip of his hardening meat.  She worked the shaft, getting her mouth getting further and further down until she was deepthroating all seven inches.  She took him out of her mouth, giggled, pumped his dick a few times and got back to work.  Within minutes he was jetting down her throat.  

“Take that shirt off and get on the bed.  I want to ride you.”

Taking his shirt off, he crawled onto the bed.  Lying down on his back in the center of the mattress, she swung a leg over him and slid up towards his cock.  Running her hands over his belly, she told him how cute and vulnerable he looked.  David smiled, then moaned as she leaned down to work him hard again with her mouth.  

It was at this point that Buck jumped into the fray.  He’d been pacing back and forth by the bed.  Leaping up into the bed, he started licking at Sarah’s exposed ass.  She yelped, then smiled and moved forward onto David’s cock.  Buck followed, continuing to lap.  Sarah mounted David, then leaned forward as she grinded on his dick and against his belly.  Buck saw the opportunity, and mounted Sarah himself, his dick bouncing off her asshole.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Dog - Father A" tags="" position="1032,807" size="100,100">Sarah had grown very fond of the sight of the two of them at the beach, and had been planning this for a while.  She was ready for it.  Reaching behind her, she guided Buck lower, towards her pussy.  Suddenly, they were both of them were inside her  

The pleasure from both cocks deep inside her pussy was significant.  She grinded against David, effectively jacking off the two dicks inside her pussy.  Buck thrust forward, and his knot popped in.  The pressure on their two cocks was too much, and both erupted.  They’d be in this position for a while until the knot deflated.  

“I can feel both of your loads hitting my womb.  Isn’t that exciting?” Sarah said.

David felt his dick twitch, and sure enough he was getting hard again inside her.  She laughed, and started gyrating again.  It took him a bit longer to get off this time, but the lubrication from both loads and the tight pussy was enough that he was spurting a follow up load in no time.  

(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Dog - Father A 1]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Dog - Father B" tags="" position="1142,806" size="100,100">Sarah panicked, realizing she bit off more than she could chew.  She had thought she wanted this, but thinking about it in that moment of clarifying panic she knew that something had been affecting her towards that decision.  She hadn’t been in control of her desires.  Jumping off of David, she grabbed her clothes and ran out the hotel room door.

Buck and David sat there, cock out and hard, looking at each other.  David had a bewildered look on his face, but both clearly felt needy.  Buck swaggered forward on the bed, assuming Sarah’s position above David.  Their cocks touched, bouncing off eachother’s hardness.  David, feeling overcome by the waves of arousal coming off of Buck, reached down to their rods and began to frot them together.  Buck whined, and licked David’s face.  Kissing back and forth as David continued to masturbate the both of them together, both were soon panting from the pleasure.  

Buck backs up slightly, David releasing his grip on their cocks.  Buck’s pole fell, swinging with heavy weight, down between David’s legs.  Completely rabid for pleasure at this point, David spread his legs in the air, crooking them towards his chest by the knee.  His mane of pubes was slick with fluids, from Sarah’s mouth and pussy as well as David and Buck’s precum.  His cock flopped toward him, drumming on his belly as he shifted into a more comfortable position for what he was about to receive.  He brought his hand down, rubbing the fluids to lube up his asshole, then grabbing Buck’s turgid cock and guiding the tip to his hole.

David hadn’t felt this confident in a while, and Buck could smell the satisfaction from both of them.  He pulled out once his knot had shrunk, a flood of cum and David’s softening cock flopping out of her stretched pussy.  Sarah leaned down and licked his penis clean, then kissed David. 

“Let’s do this again. Maybe next time one of you gets my ass and the other gets my pussy.” Sarah said, heading to the bathroom to wash up.

Buck and David would share Sarah for weeks to come, and after a few months when she started showing, they learned that she was pregnant with twins.  Anthropomorphic twins. David and Buck are going to be fathers.  Together.

Plugging away, the force of Buck’s thrusts soon had David’s cock bouncing up and down, slapping against his belly, increasing the lewd sounds coming from the room twofold.  David felt some pain, and a hint of pleasure.  As they continued fucking, David felt something about his hole changed.  It was like it was more lubricated, like it was made for Buck’s member. 

Buck had given David a gift, transforming his needy hole into a pussy.  Buck hadn’t been able to push David to claim one of his own, so he decided that he’d claim David.  They fucked for hours, changing positions a number of times as Buck bred David’s new ass pussy.  David was overcome by orgasm after orgasm from his behind, his cock now defunct and flaccid.  His favorite position to take with Buck was doggy style, if not aptly named.  His belly slapped around in the lewdest way, his breasts now fuller and with teats growing in also added to the orchestra of slaps and plaps.  By the time they left the hotel room the next day, David was completely and utterly Bucks, and deeply pregnant with a litter of pups.  He’d have to learn how to hide these transformations to his body, and perhaps it was time to take up a career as a dog breeder.

Something deep within his primal genome unlocked.  Growling and sitting on the floor, he could feel his insides shifting around.  The strange man kept pounding away, making eye contact with Buck.  Cynthia told him to get out, but Buck didn’t listen.  

A seam appeared down his muzzle, going between his eyes to the back of his skull and down to his tail.  His growling increased and he began to shake, the changes happening inside his body sending out tremors.  Growing concerned, Cynthia sent the man away and out of the house.  

“There’s something wrong with that dog, babe.” He said as he went out the front door.  He wouldn’t be coming back.  

These games continued, with Buck now directly confronting Cynthia with his actions.  She began to unravel.  It didn’t help when Buck started speaking to her in her mind, taunting her directly.  Trying to tell David about what was happening only added to the torture, as there was no way David would beleive her.  Soon she was screaming at her family, acting out at Buck in front of them, and acting increasingly violent.

Cynthia was luxuriating in bed, rubbing her pussy for a second orgasm.  Men off of dating apps were never reliable, at least as far as her pleasure was concerned.  Suddenly, Buck leapt up onto the bed and began heaving.  Cynthia grabbed at the towel she had been fucking on top of and shoved it under Buck.  With her arms underneath him placing the towel, Cynthia thought she was just in time when the dog threw up.

Out of the stream of vomit came a slug-like creature.  It latched onto her arm, sinking partway into her skin.  Cynthia shrieked, and attempted to pull it off.  Buck’s body collapsed on the bed as she scrambled to deal with this parasite on her arm.  It continued to burrow into her skin, almost the size of her palm.  She couldn’t get a grip on it.  It was too slick.  

Suddenly, awareness bloomed at the back of Cynthia’s mind.  Buck.  Buck was inside of her.  She looked down at the parasite.  It had connected to her, connected to her nervous system and was taking over.  She struggled, mentally against the invasion, and physically against the parasite on her arm.  But she didn’t have the fight in her to win.  Her shoulders sagged, her body going limp and falling down into the bed.  The parasite began to slide through her skin, now submerged underneath her epidermis.  It traveled up to her shoulder, then down, between her breasts.  It settled at the base of her spine, near her womb.  

Buck got up from the bed, her eyes snapping back into position from their position rolled upwards into her head.  Well, she’d have to start thinking of herself as Cynthia.  She wiped her arms, clearing off the puke, heading towards the shower.  She’d have to be presentable when David got back.  In the shower, she tenderly rubbed at her womb through her stomach.  Cynthia would be loyal now, and she’d give her family what they deserved.  David had always wanted another child, and she knew that with ‘Buck’ gone, Alex would need a new companion.  Hopping out of the shower, she bundled her old husk into the messy sheets and took them out the back door to the trash.

One too many glasses of wine and Buck spitting up a ruined and chewed piece of jewelry from her vanity caused her to snap like that.  Whining and laying down, Buck feigns injury.  Cynthia reached for his scruff.  Bucks mouth opened, the seam down his back opening as well.  

Tentacles whipped out, and teeth lining the seam started to gnash.  Buck had become a monster.  But a loyal monster, and he would take care of this problem for his family.  Snaking around the hand on his scruff, the tentacles pulled it into his mouth and it met those razor sharp teeth.  Cynthia screamed in pain, holding up the stump of a forearm.  She looked at Buck in terror.  He stepped forward, and screams could be heard throughout the house.

Buck was licking up the last of the blood from the floor of the kitchen when David and Alex got home.  The only evidence that she had been there recently was the abandoned wine glass on the counter.

Buck began to feel more and more dominant, sometimes coming into Alex’s room and humping the boy until he pulled down his drawers and assumed the position.  Alex seemed to become more and more submissive, forgoing reasoning and rationality for pleasure.  

Buck came into Alex’s room while he was out one day, and jumped up on the bed.  The smell of Alex poured through his nose.  That wouldn’t do.  This was Buck’s bed now, and Alex his bitch.  A desire for domination rose in the rottweiler, and his leg raised. Pee splashed all over the sheets, marking the territory as his.  Alex returned later, face red as he realized what had happened.  Buck was waiting for him in the room, and had a fat load to deposit.   Changing his sheets would have to wait. 

Tongue, knot, and piss were tools for Buck to mold Alex.  The boy was slowly turning more and more servile, more subservient.  He took it deep whenever Buck wanted, living in a cycle of humiliation and use.  Buck stepped up his torture, even pissing directly on Alex after using his hole.  He had to mark his territory after all.  Eventually Alex stopped fighting what was happening to him.  Buck had reformed Alex into a new person.  The Alex that went out with friends spent the whole time thinking about what would happen to him when he got home, his cock aching for the attention Buck would give his needy ass pussy.  He truly was a bitch.

Alex couldn’t say no, for some reason taking Buck’s seed had become like a religious experience for him.  Buck was happy to oblige.  With every load that Alex took, Buck’s desire to lay his oats grew out of control.  The dog had one task, and it was to put his seed inside the boy.  Each load seemed to be bigger than the last.  That was when it occurred to them that wasn’t the only thing that was growing.

Buck had become physically larger.  His cock had also grown to match his new body.  This continued, Buck stretching Alex more and more each night as his cock became almost too big to bear.  Eventually Alex realized that he was changing as well.  His asshole was becoming an ass pussy, the skin growing softer and stretchier.  A donut of puckered skin took up permanent residence where his cute little hole had originally been.  

After a few months of fucking, the sight of the two of them going at it was almost comical.  Buck’s cock was the size of Alex’s forearm, the dog bearing down over Alex when he mounted him.  His mango sized testicals swung heartily when he rutted against Alex. The knot popped in with ease, Alex’s lubricated and stretchy donut like a silicon toy for Buck to use.  Buck’s testes churned, releasing a proverbial flood of cum within Alex.  Alex felt his stomach begin to bloat, as the load continued to pump.  Suddenly, Buck began to grow again, right then and there in the midst of his orgasm.

Buck would come into his room, and give him a look that let Alex know it was time.  It was like he was on autopilot, his brain drunk on the pleasure, masking his thoughts when Buck gave him that stare. Alex kept up appearances, doing his chores or hanging with his friends, but he had a true calling that he always had to be ready for.  

When Buck jumped up on that bed, it was like a switch would flip.  Alex turned off, and bitch turned on.  His dreams were rife with images of him taking cock, lapping up piss from his bed.  Eventually Alex began to lose touch with the half of him that was owned by Buck.  He’d lose hours of his day, and couldn’t remember what he had been up to.  He was always having to do laundry though.  Hopefully he’d figure out how to deal with his wetting problem at college, and hopefully the dreams of himself as a pregnant dog would stop.

He retreated, socially.  This was supposed to be one final fun summer before heading off to his freshman year.  He spent the majority of those months alone with Buck.  Buck was pleased when he noticed how dog-like Alex was acting when they were together.  And they spent so much time together.

Life was so much simpler for Alex when he was with Buck.  The pressures of his upcoming year, the confusion over his identity and what he wanted in life.  With Buck, it was just need and desire, submission and dominance.  Life was so much simpler as someone’s pet, wasn’t it?  The idea became addictive to Alex, and Buck encouraged it as much as he could.

Concerned parents noticed this withdrawal, but it was too late.  One morning they found Alex in the backyard, on all fours, barking while their beloved pet Buck was breeding Alex’s ass.  Trying to talk to him, Alex would only respond by licking at their hand and barking.  They’d have to put in for a gap year to Alex’s school while they figure this out. Maybe they should try a dog trainer?

The Dog’s nuts were now the size of pineapples, and swollen with cum.  The cock pumped it into Alex like a firehose, and soon Alex was feeling something travel up his esophagus.  Cum welled into his mouth, and he began to cough it up.  Soon he was drowning in it.  Buck jumped in size again, stretching Alex to the max.  He could feel his body burdened by the now enormous cock inside him, pushing the cum up and out to make room.  Still pumping, Buck resumed his rutting.  It felt good to be this big and to be breaking his bitch so well.  Suddenly Alex was puking up cum, a puddle of it growing around his mouth.  The weight of Buck, so large now, weighed down against him, crushing him into the mattress.  He struggled to breath, between the weight and the flood of jism blocking his air canal and breaking through to his soft palate.  Buck jumped in size again.  Alex felt his vision go dark, as the spark of life left him.  The pointed tip of Buck’s cock pushed through the crushed and stretched body&#39;s mouth.   One last rope of dog seed ejected out of Buck’s cock, as he pulled out of the corpse.

Buck’s tongue was quickly lapping at her.  She let out a deep sigh and relaxed.  This was a familiar pleasure. His rough tongue rubbed at both her holes in the best way.  Petting his back and rubbing her hands through his fur, she was quickly orgasming.  Her thighs clenched, and she trembled, signaling Buck to slow.  Wagging his tail, and looking up at her, Buck let his tongue loll.

But this wasn’t the same Buck.  He jumped forward, his paws hitting her on the shoulders and throwing her off balance.  She tumbled onto her ass, spread eagle, trying to get her hands on something to pull herself up with. Buck whined and rutted forward, his now erect dog cock trying to find home, sliding up and down her abdomen. Amanda tried throwing him off, but couldn’t quite get Buck off from her position on the floor.  

“Bad boy” she said giggling, still feeling the glow from her orgasm.

Curiosity and arousal flooded Amanda.  She bit her lower lip, thinking about how she desperately needed a pick-me-up after such a rough semester.  Before she came to a conclusion, Buck’s tip found a hole.  Suddenly Amanda’s hands were on his haunches, and Buck pounded home, jack hammering the warm and wet pussy.  Amanda leaned her head forward, giving Buck a kiss.  His tongue went in her mouth, slobber and saliva from both of them dripping all over Amanda’s body from the sloppy exchange.  Buck’s knot popped inside her within minutes, and he let loose his load.  Untying her a short while after, Buck licked at her face and pussy, cleaning up his bitch.  She put her dress back on, washed her hands and then was out the bathroom door before anyone would wonder what she had gotten up to.  Buck’s load dripped past the thong on her way home, running down her legs hidden by the dress.  Amanda would be unprepared for the effect it would have on her.

She broke into a sweat, her concentration plummeting as she moved lane to lane.  Finally pulling into her apartment’s parking lot, she was practically hallucinating by the time she was inside her unit and crashed on the couch.  She thrashed in her sleep, dreaming of pleasure and heat. Oh it was so hot.  

Amanda woke up the next day, drenched in sweat.  Shuffling towards the sink, she turned on the tap and guzzled water.  She needed the fluids badly, after that night of fever dreams on the couch.  Leaning over the sink, she felt a strange sensation coming from her stomach rubbing against the counter.  Lifting her sundress up to her waist and hooking a thumb into the band of her panties she walked over to the washroom.  She had the dress over her head and her thong on the floor in a series of quick motions, and threw the soiled clothes in the washing machine.  Running hands over her body, she moved a hand to her pussy, feeling where Buck had been inside her.  Shower time.

Scrubbing in the shower, that weird sensation from her tummy became more noticeable.  It was like there was a tuft of hardened skin below her belly button.  She finished rinsing out her body wash, did her shampoo and then conditioned her hair.  She’d have to go for a hair appointment soon, deciding it was time to touch up those purple highlights and maybe get a trim. Toweling off, she noticed what appeared to be a birthmark on her stomach in the mirror opposite the shower.  Grabbing at the skin and looking down and then again at the mirror, a puzzled look came across her face.  Emblazoned on her pubic was a dog nose, just a couple shades darker than her skin.  Poking at it, she felt a jolt of pleasure.  It felt exactly like what it looked like, bumpy and raised slightly above her skin. 


(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Dog - Tutor A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Dog - Tutor B" tags="" position="1845,806" size="100,100">Buck was happy to see Amanda every time she came back over for her weekly visits.  She was smelling so good since the first time he bred her. As each week passed, and as Amanda took more and more of his loads, she smelled better and better.  More dog-like.  After a month, she couldn&#39;t resist Buck any longer, and she increased the frequency of her visits.  During a movie night over at the house, she snuck off and took Buck into the bathroom.  

Undressing for Buck, Amanda showed her tummy and pussy off to Buck.  She had teats growing down her chest and abdomen, like a dog’s.  Most noticeable, of course, was a coat of fur from her thighs to her tits.  On her pubis, at the thinnest points of the coat was a birthmark that looked like a dog&#39;s nose, even raised and bumpy like one.  She placed her hands on her tummy, presenting this emblem.  Her fingernails had become increasingly claw-like.  Buck pressed his snout into it and sniffed, nuzzling the skin and fur.  Buck knew she was his.  All it would take was one more load. 

She was dripping wet and ready when she got on all fours.  He mounted her, his claws digging into her skin as he took her roughly.  He wanted this, he wanted to change her and make her his own, forever.  He thrust deep and let out his cum inside her, knot holding him in place within her.  Suddenly, Amanda could feel her body changing.  And changing fast.  She grabbed her phone from her purse and started typing a note.  It was to her family, because she’d never see them again. At least, not as Amanda.  

She typed quickly, before her hands changed too much to handle the keyboard.  Her body was snapping and shrinking, becoming more compact as her muscles, bones, and organs rearranged.  Soon the phone lay forgotten on the floor, as Buck and his new bitch left the room for the backyard.

A week went by, it was time for her next tutoring session with Alex.  Amanda knew Buck would be waiting for her.  When she approached the house, her vision flashed and she could see herself walking up from the window.  Snapping back before she could stumble, she dry heaved from the wave of pleasure that had come with the vision.  It was Buck, and somehow he was in her mind.  Greeting her at the door with Cynthia, Buck was acting playful and normal.  She found Alex in her room, and closed the door behind her.  Attempting to help him with his study prep, she became overcome by another vision. It was a cock knotted deep in a pussy, pumping a load deep inside.  Her legs trembled under the table, and her pussy flooded with grool.  She could almost feel Buck waiting at the door.  Excusing herself when Alex was occupied with a problem, she headed to the bathroom.  They were thinking at each other, sharing visions back and forth on the way to the bathroom.  When they arrived, the door locked behind them, Amanda knew what it was time for.   She was on all fours and being bred, moaning in ecstasy.  She had to clasp a hand over her mouth to stop herself from being so loud as to alert the others in the house.  Nothing felt so right as Buck’s cock knotting her.  The imprint on her mons darkened as he unleashed his seed inside of her.  She was marked, forever.  

Amanda was walking to her car through the neighborhood, having parked a block away.  She noticed dogs appearing in the yards of nearby houses, and she could ‘hear’ them.  Her womb started to ache again.  Life would never be the same.

Little did he know, but fate had determined he was in for some change.  A microscopic organism originating from primordial space dust, attached to a meteorite and carried on the winds, had found its way to him.  This organism, this seed, was of a corrupting nature.  Like a burr on a pant leg, this seed latched onto Alex and buried deep within him.  How would this seed change him? Absolutely.  His mind, already warping itself to the taboo and sexual by his own training, Alex would be quick to embrace the changes he could affect on those around him, and on himself. Where would he start?

Cynthia is a short woman, but she’s never let that get in her way of getting what she wants.  She’d carried Alex, so her body was a little motherly.  But she kept it tight, and worked on it whenever she could find the time. Her hair was well kept, she saw her stylist every couple of months.  She had a bob that she liked to keep short, especially her bangs.  She made herself up every day, and always wore an outfit that complimented her.  She has hazel eyes, and plump lips.  Her breasts are sizable, with a D cup and a small band size.   Any fat she had on her body sat on her tummy or her hips and ass.  Very much the body of a mother you’d like to fuck.   



&#39;&#39;Personality:&#39;&#39;

Cynthia is a vain woman, and rather hedonistic.  She’s been making excuses for her cheating to herself for years, and has racked up quite the body count.  She’d never wanted kids.  She’d had one with David to secure the bag, so to speak.  She always liked him, but privately she never thought of herself as the loving type.  Except herself, she definitely loved herself.


&#39;&#39;Kinks and Fetishes:&#39;&#39;

Cheating and cuckoldry are big ones for Cynthia, obviously.  She incorporates toys in a lot of her sessions.  She’s also into gang bangs, and cumplay.  At least once a year, she organizes a bukkake event at a hotel.  Usually she invites any Johns that she’s fucked in the last calendar year.  



(text-colour:magenta)[[[//Play her story.//-&gt;Mother - Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Tutor" tags="" position="4166,53" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Description:&#39;&#39;

Amanda is in her early twenties, and has a tight young body.  Fair skin, though she often rocks a tan and black hair that she usually has highlighted.  Currently, it’s purple streaks running through it.  She likes to keep it tied up or in a braid of some sort.  Her body is thin, but healthy.  Pert torpedo-like breasts jut from her lithe frame.   Her cup size is pretty small, and she’s a little embarrassed that she doesn’t have bigger assets.  Her ass is cute and pert, but not substantial.  She keeps her ussy shaved and waxed.   

&#39;&#39;Personality:&#39;&#39;

She’s a little trepidatious, and lacks some confidence.  She loves learning, and desires to connect to people.  Her favorite part of her graduate program is the conversations she gets in her classes with people.  She craves attention and is in serious need of some kind of partner.  

&#39;&#39;Kinks and Fetishes:&#39;&#39;

She’s a bit of a weeb and has always looked at hentai and doujinshi.  Parasite is one of her favorite tags.  Body modification, tentacles, possession.  Those sorts of things.  These are linked to her deep rooted desire for domination.  She won’t admit it, but she wants to be in charge.


(text-colour:lime)[[[//Play her story.//-&gt;Tutor - Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Son - Father" tags="" position="1980,699" size="100,100">Alex has always struggled with his feelings for men.  He’d been in denial forever.  He’d stare at fellow students in the locker rooms, catching sight of bulges and blushing, thinking that he was embarrassed at the sight of sexual things and not because of them.  And he’d always admired his father.  David was such a good guy, kind and loving, treating everyone with respect.  David wanted to be like David when he grew up, or maybe he wanted to be with someone like his dad.  He couldn’t say.  

Catching sight of his dad getting out of the shower while in his parent’s room to ask his mother permission for something was something that happened all too often for a coincidence.  It was almost like Alex would try to make that happen.  During the summers, when they’d use the pool in the backyard, Alex would regularly find his eyes resting on his father’s junk.  Was he envious, or did he want it in another way?  Whichever it was, his dad certainly had a piece of meat on him.  Alex’s didn’t compare at all.  

When he started introducing toys into his sexual play, he found himself buying a number of toys that represented his father’s cock the best.  Occasionally he’d catch himself fantasizing that the dildo inside of him was his father, or at least a man that looked like his father; big, fat and hairy, droopy balls, meat hanging lower…

He couldn’t help it, his nature pushed him towards the taboo, and a little time on the internet had him converted into camp incest.  It wasn’t hard, because his mother also had a very nice body and wasn’t some dumpy looking mother he’d like to avoid.  He had always been that guy teased for having the hot mom in middle school and highschool.  

The idea that his fantasies could become a reality came about after his infection by the cosmic seed.  It prompted him to ramp up his advances, and he found himself breaking into her cloud accounts to try and snag some sexy photos.  What he found was something else entirely.  An album with hundreds of entries, each entry a photo of his caring and loving mother with a different cock over her shoulder.  She’d clearly been using it in each one, cum on her tits or her face was not an uncommon sight.  

Knowing that she wasn’t fucking his dad, and she was busy fucking all these Johns filled him with anger, and with arousal.  He had to do something, and he knew exactly what to do.  He made a dating profile on the service his mother used, and swiped his way through until he got to her profile.  He’d made his profile to match her type, and within a few hours of liking her profile, they matched.

Growing up, Amanda had baby sat Alex, spent time with him as friends when their parents visited each other.  Family friends, and they were both single children.  So they’d had to get along.  When they’d gotten into middle school and highschool respectively, things had gotten weird between them.  Amanda was growing up, and Alex couldn’t help but notice.  Then she’d gone away to college.  Now she was back, and he was soon to head off himself.  

Alex had grown up into a strong young man, and Amanda had eyes for him after those four years.  She still looked roughly the same, a petite body with fair skin and black shoulder length hair with purple highlights.  She often wore it braided in some fashion.  He loved her look, she always had cute outfits on that framed her body well.  She knew how to dress and how to rock her body, even if it was on the thin side.  

That summer, the spark was there.  They were flirty with each other, finding excuses to spend time with each other.  She came over at least once a week to ‘tutor’ him, because he needed ‘help’ getting ready for college.  Their activities were innocent at first, watching movies, talking about books they were reading, going for a walk down to the corner store to get a slushie to cool off.  Summer things.  

The energy crackling beneath these hangouts was palpable, and Alex knew all it would take was a little push to see him and Amanda get together.  He knew they both wanted to make something, but with his life about to change with going away for four years, it seemed impossible to make whatever it could be permanent.  Permanent change would come for them, however, thanks to a late night streaming binge at Alex’s house.

They were so comfortable with each other.  Buck often slept in Alex&#39;s bed, and they snuggled often.  When Alex was a kid, he had practiced &#39;kissing&#39; with Buck, but had stopped after he realized it was weird.  This bond between the two of them became a focal point for Alex to focus his desires into, feeding the seed of corruption deep within him. 

When Alex woke up the morning after the seed anchored inside of him, he felt exceptionally horny.  Buck’s warm body was against him.  He leaned down, and Buck turned his muzzle up towards Alex away from the sheets.  Giving each other ‘kisses’ brought Alex great comfort and fanned the flames of corruption and arousal within him. They made out for almost an hour, Buck’s tongue delving deep into Alex’s mouth.  Alex suckled on it, drinking in the spit and saliva from the dog’s mouth.  Buck clambered on top of Alex, straddling him as he slobbered all over the moaning young boy.  

Alex jerked himself off during the tantric session.  He was lost within the event, stroking slowly and relishing in the pleasure.  His mind was ablaze, feeling only the tongue, the spit and his cock.   He groaned, convulsing as he let loose his seed all over his chest.  Buck wandered off, and he fell back into the mattress, drifting off.  

He slept lightly, dreaming of dogs playing, roughhousing, and fucking.  He turned and tossed, sweating into his sheets.  When he woke up, he knew he had been bonded to Buck.  The transfer of essences during their make out had been potent, and he’d poured himself into Buck.  He could feel the dog puttering about the house, sniffing things and then sitting down to groom himself.  Alex could visualize the bond, like it was a thickly knotted rope connecting the two of them.  He could reach out and touch it, altering the bond, or both of them.  He wanted to be with Buck, but he had to figure out how to make it real and something sustainable.

He wanted to be bigger, he wanted to have a bigger cock, he wanted to be with someone bigger, someone with a bigger cock.  The frustration and the denial swirled around his waking thoughts, and his sleeping thoughts.  One sweaty summer evening, he found his father on the couch in the living room.  He was half passed out, in a tee shirt and boxers. A number of beer bottles sat around the bottom of the couch, one still in his Dad’s hand.  

Alex moved over to the couch, and took the bottle out of his father’s strong, big, thick fingered hands.  He was letting his mind wander.  A twitch flashed through his pants, and he could feel his unimpressive manhood begin to grow.  He licked his lips, and looked down at his father.  Presumably he was getting drunk on his own because of his mother.  Alex knew she wasn’t very good to him, and her absence recently had been noted.  He could see his father, straining against his boxers, likely having gone without the touch of another in months.  

The seed worked itself on Alex, pushing him off the plank into the deep end.  Suddenly he found himself crouched, putting the bottle on the ground with the others.  He reached his hands up to his father’s waist, feeling the fly on the boxers.  Sliding a finger through the material, he widened it enough for his father’s cock to be visible.  One finger slipped in, then two, then a thumb.  Hooking underneath the half hard cock, they pulled upward and freed the rod from its plaid prison.  Looking at his father, he couldn’t detect any evidence that he had been roused from his slumber.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Son - Father 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Son - Father 3" tags="" position="1981,911" size="100,100">Grabbing the shaft in his fist, and running his thumb under the head, he began to stroke and rub.  Minutes ached by, and precum began to trickle down his fingers.  Desire flashed through him, and he found himself taking his own cock out and rubbing it.  A naughty thought piled on top of the already outrageous list of actions he was undertaking.  Taking his father’s hand, the one that had been holding the half empty beer bottle, he moved it to his turgid cock and began to use it to stroke himself off.  The touch of a stranger was something he wasn’t used to, and the whole act of degeneracy led to him quickly finishing. 

Slowly scraping the ropes of seed from his father’s fingers, he applied it quietly to his other project.  The added lubrication had him sliding up and down his father’s shaft, and his father soon exploded himself.  David moaned lightly in his sleep, but again showed no sign of waking.  Alex removed his hand, covered in his own jism as well as Davids.  He licked it up greedily, savoring the taste of mixing seeds.  Placing the hand he’d used to jerk himself off on his father’s now softening crotch, he left to go to his room.  Hopefully that would save him the trouble of cleaning his father up and getting him back into his boxers.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//David wasn’t really that asleep, but was too scared and turned on to stop what was happening.//-&gt;Son - Father A]]]

(text-colour:blue)[[[//David would have woken up, if not for the trance he was put under by Alex’s corrupt actions.//-&gt;Son - Father B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Son - Father A" tags="" position="1894,1025" size="100,100">Sensing his son leave the room, David opened his eyes.  He was amazed at what had just happened, and was honestly incredibly turned on.  The touch of another on his cock was something he’d not felt in too long, and he was yearning for more.  But first he’d have to have a talk with his son about consent. 

The next evening, Alex was called into the living room.  He found his father, sitting on the couch, wearing gym shorts and a tee.  He was wearing the same, though he didn’t think it was likely his father was wearing panties and a bralette under his clothing.  Fearing that he’d been caught, he sat down, staring off into nothing, preparing for the conversation that would lead to him being kicked to the curb.  

As they got into it, Alex started making the realization that his Father wouldn’t take things that far.  He heard the word grounded, the dissociation hitting him hard.  Before he could register what was happening, his father’s hand was on his thigh.  Looking up, the passion in David’s eyes was immediately apparent.  

“Maybe we could try this again, but the right way this time.” David said, stroking his hand up and down his son’s thigh.


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Son - Father A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="Son - Father B" tags="" position="2073,1023" size="100,100">Alex was thinking about the previous night all the next day.  The idea of repeating the encounter was arousing to him beyond belief, and he wished oh so desperately that another opportunity would present itself.   He was addicted to his Dad’s cock and cum after just one taboo night on the couch.  That night he snuck out, and lo and behold there was his father, splayed out on the couch.  Alex touched his father, shaking his arm. No response.  Feeling bold, he cupped David’s bulge directly with his hand.  Again, no response.  Alex lipped his lips, and kneeled down to get to work. 

Every night, Alex would find his father in the same position.  His arousal burned like a furnace when he had his father’s cock in his hands.  Alex would rub his cock against his father’s hand when it was flopped over the side of the couch or against the side of the couch itself, only a little grinding was needed to send him cascading into orgasm.  After weeks of this, he was cumming hands free while working a load out of his dad.  Constantly dripping precum, he was like a hose whenever he was tending to his father&#39;s needs.  Alex used his juices to lubricate David’s dick as he worked it, like it was his own personal bottle of lube.  

Alex became increasingly obsessed, living for the late night hand jobs he was giving his dad.  It was nearly religious for him.  Seeing those waves of jism erupt from David’s cock was like seeing the second coming.  Well, the second orgasm he gave his dad each night was more like that.  He absolutely lived to pleasure that cock.  

His own penis had grown defunct, outside of the dribble of ejaculate that he constantly provided during the late night sessions.  All sexual desire left him except during their nightly ritual.

Alex was greeted by the sight of a jerk off compilation featuring all kinds of porn.  Pulling his gym shorts down, David looked at Alex and asked him what he was waiting for.  Alex reached down and grabbed his father’s rock hard member.  He couldn’t believe it.  Then the panic set in as his father snaked his hand into Alex’s shorts.  The panties.  Sliding his finger under the band of the thong, David popped his son’s junk out of the thin strip of material.  

“Shaved, and wearing a thong? You’re naughtier than I give you credit for.”

In response, and becoming overcome by the lust floating around the room, Alex raised a hand to his shirt and lifted it over his head, revealing the bralette flat against his chest.  He then pulled his gym shorts all the way off, revealing himself completely.  Soon enough, they both had a hand wrapped around the other’s cock, eyes focused on pornographic cornucopia on their TV.  There was a lot of trans porn in this compilation, yet Alex was unsurprised by this after how far things had come along.  

When Alex let out his first shots, his father caught them in his hand and then brought that hand to bear to Alex’s mouth.  He knew.  Alex made eye contact with his father as he brought his mouth down and started cleaning the slimy fingers.  

“Nice and clean, now.  Be a good girl for me.” David said, acting surprised at how dirty he was talking. 


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Son - Father A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Son - Father A 3" tags="" position="1895,1238" size="100,100">They were both getting quite caught up in this event.  Alex moved both hands to his father, now jerking him with renewed effort.  Within another ten minutes or so his father was unloading powerful jets of cum from his rod, Alex moving off the couch to lick them up where they landed.  David told him he’d expect Alex tomorrow at the same time.  Alex smiled, and wheeled around to walk out of the room.  As he was moving into the next room over, Alex turned back to his father and said something in as cute a voice as he could summon up.

“I’m looking forward to it, daddy…”

They continued jerking each other off, gooning to porn together most evenings.  Alex became more and more bold with his clothing choices, wearing more and more women&#39;s clothing and lingerie.  He favored skirts, especially high rise and low cut ones because it gave David easy access to his penis.  That of course, also began to change at the constant touch from his dad.  It grew, becoming six inches while hard.  He took longer to reach orgasm as well, matching his father in timing.  The cum play between them grew more raunchy as well, going for multiple Os a session and swapping the cum between each other&#39;s mouths as they made out.  

Some weeks into these jerk off sessions, Alex&#39;s body also began to grow.  He found his pecs filling out his bras more and more, his hips gaining fat and widening.  His hair grew out, and he began to do his makeup every day.  Alex began to resemble the trans models he jerked his father off to, and even began to think of himself as… Alexis.  Alexis wanted more, and started taking her daddy deep in her ass.  But she always got a reach around in return.  Maybe the two of them should start filming something of their own for a compilation.

Applying the cum, he began to feel a sense of awareness from his fathers cock, like a bond was forming.  He could feel his fingers, the pulse of blood through the head.  He continued pumping, and scooped more of his seed as it dripped down his scrotum.  

Slathering the seed onto David’s hard member, his vision split and he could see the point of view from his fathers cock as if it were looking at him while he jerked it off.  Pleasure blossomed in his awareness, as if it was like he could feel the other cock.  Jism pushed out his cock, now not so much dribbling as streaming.  Alex moved his hands hurriedly, grabbing as much of it as he could, seeking the strange pleasure and sensation he had just felt.  

Transferring more and more of what seemed to be literally his essence, he was leaking nonstop.  His own vision began to dim, and only the view of himself from the point of view of his father’s groin was left to guide his motions.  And then, that was all there was.  Alex’s body, fingers still wrapped around him, was motionless and drooling.  Alex was needy, and he wanted to orgasm.  His dad would have to find someone new to masturbate him.  He’d enjoy life as this thick piece of meat, much more than he’d enjoyed his own life.  

The body that had previously been Alex slumped beside the couch, fingers leaving what was now Alex alone in the cold.  Sending signals to his host&#39;s brain, David was soon awake, cock in hand.  Alex could feel their orgasm growing.

He wanted to test this theory, so he decided to experiment with something drastic.  He climbed on top of his father, straddling him on the couch, his leaky dick dripping semen down onto his father’s crotch.  

Alex started grinding.  He frotted his limp and leaky clitty against his father’s rock solid penis, the slippery friction causing an exquisite feeling.   Permanently soft at this point, his penis remained mostly inside his pubis, simply a leaky factory.  But he wanted to feel more, to do more with his dick.  He wanted to use it to pleasure his father.  Guiding David’s cock towards his own, he pushed it up against his retreating dick.  A glob of cum pumped out of his urethra, giving Alex the lube he’d need.  He began to push down, squirming against the turgid pole.  

Suddenly he felt hands on his hips, and he looked up to make eye contact with David.  His father nodded at him, and he took a break and nodded back.  He pushed down, and his father thrusted up.  Alex felt a crack and heard a pop.  He slid further down his father&#39;s shaft.  His dick was now truly useless, completely widened enough to accommodate his father&#39;s cock.  Perfectly lubricated, and totally ruined. He began to ride up and down, moaning sweetly as he serviced his father.

She was in for a surprise, and he’d be ready when she got there.  Printing out a folder full of these trophies, he planned on revealing that he knew what she was up to, and that he wanted to have a piece of her pie. His lust and anger were twisted around his heart.  Waiting in the room patiently, Alex went over in his mind what he’d say.  Texts pinged his phone at intervals as the date approached.  She was wet for him, she wanted him to see the lingerie she’d picked out.  The usual stuff.  Alex had played her well.

She opened the door to the room and came inside.  Soft lighting obscured the room from her, the bright hallway lights blinding her from behind.  She strode into the room, closing the door behind her, and her coat was open revealing her outfit.  A babydoll, styled like a maid’s garment, ran over her soft motherly curves down towards a G-string thong and a pair of hold up thigh highs all the way down to her dark red pumps.  Her blonde bob and bangs straightened against her face, suiting her makeup nicely. Red crimson lips smiled in anticipation.  Then she saw who waited for her in the room as her eyes adjusted.

Alex was standing in front of her while she leafed through the folder, slamming it shut after seeing three of the prints inside.  She knew what the rest would be.  

“Alex, baby, this isn’t…” she tried to say before he put a finger to her lips, shushing her. 

“I’ll do the talking.  I know you’ve been fucking around on Dad for years.  I also know you haven’t been performing your wifely duties to him in a while.  I shudder to think how if you were a little less of a slut and a little happier to be with Dad I might not have had to grow up a single child.  I can never forgive this, there is no penance you can pay.  I wonder if I’m even his son, sometimes.” David spilled his heart out in a calm, chilled tone.

“Unfortunately you are his, I made sure of it.  I haven’t loved your father in a long time, and he’s never been able to satisfy me.  I didn’t think he was worthy of another child, and you were my perfect baby boy, Alex.  I didn’t need anything else from hi–”

Alex interrupted her by shoving his finger inside her mouth.  She gagged on it, then accepted it.  David began to talk again.

“Except his money, and the lifestyle he provides for you.  And his loyalty.  All you do is take what you want and leave everyone else to fend for themselves.  Now I’m going to take what I want.  (text-colour:magenta)[[[Open your mouth, slut.-&gt;Son - Mother A 2]]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="Son - Mother B" tags="" position="2349,907" size="100,100">A smile set into her face, and her eyes lit up.  She was probably already guessing what was going on.  Maybe she’d fantasized about this, or expected some kinda gotcha. Maybe this wasn’t her first time getting blackmailed.  But she certainly did not expect her son. At least this would be exciting, her sex life had grown rather dull.

He walked up, holding a manila folder.  He was mumbling something as he thrust it forward.  It didn’t matter what was inside, she’d already decided what she wanted to do with him.  When David felt the folder leave his hands, it was like something in the room shifted.  He felt small, and weak.  His mother opened the folder, and took out a picture.  She held it up and smiled, licking her lip.  

“This guy&#39;s name is Brad.  He was a decent lay, maybe a four out of five.  We went for a couple rounds, I rode his dick each time.  Only a couple of orgasms, but it was fun nonetheless.  As you can see he wanted to finish on my face, so I made sure to snap a pic after he busted.  What is it exactly you want me to say here? I’m sorry for cheating? Because I’m not.  Sex is an amazing thing–a wonderful thing, and I’ve always had it as much as I want, when I want.  Sex made you, even if I had to have it with you dad.  He’s a nice enough guy, and I can’t say I didn’t marry for money, (text-colour:magenta)[[[but he’s not that great in bed.-&gt;Son - Mother B 2]]]&quot;  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="Son - Mother A 2" tags="" position="2224,1021" size="100,100">Cynthia obeyed, eyes widening as she felt the power of his words. It didn’t make sense, and she didn’t want to fuck her son, but she couldn’t resist.  The room almost seemed to dim when he shoved more fingers inside her mouth.  She was licking them, sucking on them.  She could see his bulge, much larger than she ever thought he’d be capable of, growing against his slacks.  This was bad, she was starting to get turned on.  She could feel her pussy against her thong, the thin material barely covering her moistening lips.  

Alex removed his fingers from her mouth, and watched as the trail of saliva spread between.  He felt so powerful.  So strong, and dominant.  Like he could ask for anything and she’d do it.  She got a look in her eyes, a mix of consternation and arousal, and then she raised her hands to his fly.  She made quick work of his pants, they were around his ankles and his now 8” dong was hanging in front of her, bumping against her chin.  She giggled, and took him in her mouth.  He closed his eyes as he grabbed her by the back of the head, running his fingers through her short blonde hair.  Guiding her up and down his impressive shaft, he let her lubricate his cock.  A few minutes went by, and he opened his mouth to order her for what was to come next.

She obeyed, turning on the bed and getting onto all fours.  He reached down and pulled greedily at the G-string.  It snapped like it was nothing, exposing her sloppy pussy.  She was so ready for him.  He thrust in deeply in one go, bottoming out against her cervix.  She moaned, half in pain and half in pleasure.  The sight of her backside was very arousing.  Her well used asshole sat between two voluminous cheeks, slight love handles topping her lower back as his eyes moved north.  The dimples in her lower back were quite the sight.  The corners and angles, curves and shapes of his mothers body were most erotic.  Her large breasts bounced around underneath her, swinging back and forth as he plugged away.

Alex knew he’d never last this long, and he knew his cock had never been this big. The exchange between them had altered him there in the room.  But he didn’t care, he was extracting what he was owned from her pussy and nothing had ever felt so good.  The wet noises of him slamming home into the pussy that had borne him to life filled the room, wet slap after wet slap.  She orgasmed on his cock, her pussy clenching three, then four times before he reached his own orgasm.  

As he felt his balls begin to rise, he leaned down and whispered in his mother’s ear, grabbing roughly at one of her tits as he did so.

“I’m about to give you another child.  Aren’t you happy, mother?”

She moaned, squealed, and came on his cock right as he exploded deep inside.  He’d enjoy fucking her curvy and fecund body once she started showing.  He knew that David would be happy to raise another child, and he looked forward to having a new sibling, even with the age gap.

“I’ve made copies, I’ll make sure dad sees them.  He’s going to divorce you, you’re…. You’re terr-”

She cut him off, standing up and putting her hands on his waist.  

“You’re not going to tell him a fucking thing.  Not if I have a picture of the two of us fucking as well.  There’s no way you’d blow up both of our lives.  And the evidence of you engineering this meeting so we would fuck? What a pervy little brat you are.  You’d be in the doghouse just as easily as I would.” 

She had her hands in his pants before he knew it, sneaking a button undone and a fly pulled down when he was stunned by her words.  A warm hand gripped his cock, little as it was, and started stroking it.  His composure crumpled.  She had him sitting down on the bed, kneading his man meat and gripping his balls firmly.  

“Well this isn’t going to do.  I’ll have to buy you a cage.  I can&#39;t have you getting up to any of your pervert schemes after this, I think I’m going to keep you locked until (text-colour:magenta)[[[this thing might as well shrivel up and fall off.-&gt;Son - Mother B 3]]]&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="Son - Mother B 3" tags="" position="2340,1131" size="100,100">He felt so weak, his knees trembling, and then he was spewing his load into his mother’s hand.  Had that really been so exciting to hear he couldn’t help himself? What was happening, why was his plan going so awry?  She laughed, then brought her hand up to his mouth.  He opened his mouth, and received his nut, lapping it up.  Click.  She had her phone out, and had taken a picture.  His shame grew.  

She shoved him back into the bed, climbing up on top of him, moving forward until she straddled just below his neck.  His mother reached down to her panties, and pulled them quickly to the side.  Without a word, she moved forward, mounting his face with her sopping wet pussy.  He was on his back, dick still dripping cum from his orgasm, and eating the pussy he had been born out of.  He could see her phone, held horizontally, clearly taking a video.  His mother rode his face, bucking back and force. Alex moaned when she reached back and pulled at his cock.  Her thighs clenched, and he felt his face become truly drenched in her fluids.  She laughed, half panting from the orgasm.  

“I can’t believe this beta bitch boy of mine tried to blackmail me.  You are your father’s son, that’s for sure.  Maybe I’ll call up Brad or one of the other guys still kicking around town to use your ass.  That’s the only way you’re cumming with that cage on.  Maybe I’ll give them the key, or maybe I’ll just lose it forever.  This is gonna be fun.  Thank you, I really needed this.”

He moaned, eyes rolling into his head.  She had grabbed his sack again, and was squeezing.  Alex couldn’t help but get excited again at the thought of the ways his mommy was going to bully him.

It’s erotic and tantalizing, and a complete fantasy.  The whole idea of being stuck in time, hunting humans for prey and keeping them as pets to feed on, it was enthralling.  The cast of the program featured a young couple, something Alex could envision himself and Amanda as.  

They were cuddling on the couch, watching this program straight through.  The new season was supposed to be peak television, and they were lapping it up.  Hours had gone by on the couch, and Alex was sweating in the warm summer night.  Especially with Amanda cuddling so close to him on the couch. He gulped at his iced tea, drinking thirstily.  But it didn’t quench his thirst.  

He looked over at Amanda, and gulped.  She was sleeping softly against his shoulder.   Her neck, exposed and showcasing her musculature and the pale skin wrapped around it.  So thirsty.  Pain lanced through his jaw as his canines altered.  Just a little taste.  

Alex slipped a hand across her stomach, slipping down to the band of her gym shorts.  They showed so much leg, leaving little to the imagination.  Her thighs looked tight and long, like heaven.  His fingers eased their way down below the band, finding a smooth and slick wetness.  


(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Son - Tutor A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Son - Tutor B" tags="" position="2571,801" size="100,100">Alex had been ecstatic when he’d found out that Amanda was into anime.  They’d always been into pokemon and the like as kids, but when she picked up one of his volumes that he kept on a shelf in his bedroom and knew what it was and what it was about, they quickly bonded over it.  It turned out that she was actually a bigger weeb that he was.  She had pictures of her figurine collection on her phone for him to look at, and he found it funny that it was a very… buxom collection.  She clearly had good tastes.  

Deciding that they should binge a new show together, they settled on a romance anime.  It was about a normal highschool aged guy, who was a bit introverted, making friends and falling in love with a ‘gyaru’.  She explained to him that it meant a certain style of dress and appearance, usually denoted by bleached and dyed hair, lots of jewelry and make-up, and American style clothing.  To him it kind of sounded like the kind of girl you’d meet at a club in the 2000s, if he’d ever been at a club in the 2000s.  Maybe something close to a bimbo?

Anyway, they were enjoying the show.  It was adorable, and quite sexy on occasion.  The two protagonists were attractive and likable, and in a way they were reminded of themselves.  Amanda didn’t quite see it though, she didn’t have the outright confidence of the gyaru character.  After a few compliments though, she seemed more receptive.  Each week a new episode came out, and each week they gathered at Alex’s house to watch it.  It was the perfect show for the two of them.  


(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Son - Tutor B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="Son - Tutor A 2" tags="" position="2461,908" size="100,100">His fingers were inside her, rousing her from her slumber.  Her eyes fluttered open just as his mouth met her neck.  His fangs sunk in, and she gasped.  Paralytic dripped from his fangs into her bloodstream. She moaned, and sank back into him and the couch.  He suckled on her blood as he continued his tender movements with his fingers.  She continued to moan, but couldn’t move her body enough to turn to him.  She also couldn’t speak.  Helpless against his touch and his teeth.

As she reached orgasm, he drew deeply with his mouth.  He could feel her pulse flutter faintly, and then stop.  He had drained her dry just as she welled up in passion.  A perfect moment.  He brought his forearm up to his mouth, and bit down.  Blood dripped from the wound, and he angled the flow down her slack mouth.  Her body convulsed, and he could hear her heart kickstart.  Amanda’s hands went flying up to his chest, and suddenly she was pushing him down into the couch, atop him and straddling his legs.  She was panting hard, the rough awakening to her new body leaving her winded.  

“It’s only fair if you have your way with me, that I get a turn.  And I’ve never been so thirsty in my life.  I think I’m going to drink straight from the tap.”

She slid off him, getting down on her knees as she worked at his pants.  She took his hardness in her hands, and fangs shot down from the canines on her top row of teeth.  Alex swallowed, uncomfortable with where she was about to drink from.  But fair was only fair, he guessed.  They’d have a lot of time in their lives to continue getting even.

He commented on her tan, saying the summer sun was suiting her nicely.  She blushed and thanked him.  Then he noticed more piercings on her ears, additional lobe piercings at first, and then orbitals and helix piercings.  They complimented her look.  She was wearing cuter and cuter outfits.  He always made comments about them, and she seemed to be surprised by them.  How odd. But she glowed with each mention of her appearance. 

The most stark change was her hair.  Always black and more recently with purple highlights, he was caught by surprise when she showed up one week for the episode watching with bleached and platinum dyed hair.   She had it loosely tied up at the back of her head.  It suddenly occurred to him that she was beginning to look more and more like the character from the show.  Was she intentionally trying to emulate the look to give him a message? Should he, like the male protagonist, work up to making a move on her?  He grabbed her by the waist, filled with confidence of his own all of a sudden, and pulled her towards himself.  

“I love your new hair.  It’s a great look on you.”

She seemed completely caught off guard, looking him in the eyes and smiling with a surprised look.  She laughed, shrugging him off and making her way to the nearby bathroom to inspect her hair.  When she came out, the skirt she’d been wearing was a little shorter, the crop top she had been wearing a little tighter.  Were her breasts bigger?  She was definitely wearing more makeup.  Her lips looked like they’d be nice to kiss.  She swaggered over to him, and he noticed she was wearing heeled booties as well.  Had she been wearing them when she got here?

She leaned in to kiss him.  He was amazed, but he went along with it, no problem.  He pulled her closer, his hands going down to her ass.  He found the edge of her skirt, and pulled it up.  He grabbed two handfuls of ass, and she moaned into his mouth.  Alex could feel her tits against his shirt, she wasn’t wearing a bra and that little piece of clothing she called a crop top didn’t leave much to the imagination.  

Amanda fumbled at his pants, and he unzipped her skirt.  She wriggled out of it, and it dropped to the floor.  An animal print G-string revealed itself, and he thumbed at it.  She took the pause in action to work his pants all the way down, his boxers going with it. He flopped out, as much as he could with his still fairly unimpressive cock.  She didn’t care though.  Amanda grabbed at it, pulling on it and stroking it until it stood erect between them.  He took his shirt off, the few wisps of golden blonde hair on his chest catching the cool air of the room.  His nipples hardened with arousal.  Amanda pulled at her crop top, bunching the material at the bottom underneath her breasts as she pulled up slowly.  Her breasts strained against the motion, eventually plopping out.  They weren’t that impressive, but they were perky and sexy enough for any man.  Her swollen nipples were like eraser heads, and he grabbed at them with his hands.  Soft and pliable, he massaged at her chest.   

They shuffled over to the couch, where she instructed him to lie down.  His cock bobbed in the air, and he looked up at her.  What did she have planned?  Amanda climbed on top of him, in a reversed position.  Her pussy hovered in the air over his head as she clambered into position.  He felt a wetness enveloping his cock, and fingers grabbing at his balls. Alex reached up and pulled at her haunches, bringing the tight and pinky shaved pussy to his mouth.  He lapped up and down, thumbing at her clit.  His tongue wandered north and south, east and west.  She moaned when his tongue found her asshole.  When she came on his face, it occured to Alex that they’d probably wouldn’t be getting to that episode tonight.  It was time for their own love story.

Alex imagined all of the things they’d do together, what their relationship would mean.  How Buck would be changed.  How Buck would look; 6’3”, leaning down over him, strong arms grabbing at his backside, stubble scraping against Alex’s cheek… the thoughts burned at him, and he burned them into the bond.  

Alex has grown a taste for Buck&#39;s fluids.  He&#39;s so turned on by the thought of drinking more of Buck&#39;s saliva.  They make out every night and morning, Alex becomes completely enraptured and love-drunk at the idea.  The sessions gave him power and strengthened the effect he could have on the bond.  But he needed more, something to seal the changes he was pushing through the bond.  A name, perhaps.  Brett.

When Alex awoke the morning after this revelation and subsequent focusing of the bond, he awoke next to Brett instead of Buck.  Well, human enough.  A stubby dog tail still sat above his finely shaped ass, long canine teeth and sharp nails still populated Brett’s body.  Ears rode high on Brett’s skull, fairly doglike in shape.  Brett was older, at least as old as his dad.  Buck had been an old boy after all.  Still sleeping, Brett rolled over and stretched, revealing a furry sheath and a large bulge and sack.  Alright, more than a few things were still dog-like.  More work would be done through the bond.  He thought he might keep the upgraded package though.

Alex knew the conversion would require a lot of work, and as the nights went on his dreams helped to shape Buck through that bond.  They were both dogs in his dreams, Buck a female dog and himself a male one.  They ran together, humping and playing all through the underbrush of the forest.  They were happy dreams, if not arousing.  

In his waking hours, Alex imagined what their relationship would look like. He loved Buck, and if Buck was to become his woman he’d want her to carry his children.  Love welled in his mind, and pushed along the bond.  Buck and Alex snuggled together, Alex running his hands through Buck’s short fur.  HIs feelings ran along the bond like grain through a sieve.  He could feel the pull on him.  But it was too much, too fast.  He didn’t have a firm image in his mind, just the feelings.  He didn’t know what form this would take place, and that would cause his push against the bond to backfire.

When Alex returned to consciousness, he immediately saw Buck above him, and Buck was different.  Anthropomorphic looking, like he was half man and half dog, a muzzled face and covered in fur, but clearly in the shape of a human.  Buck had his hand on Alex’s face and stroked it as he shushed him as Alex started to speak.

“It’s okay Alex.  We’ve both changed.  Though I don’t think Alex is (text-colour:red)[[[going to work as a name for you anymore.-&gt;Son - Dog B 2]]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="Son - Dog A 2" tags="" position="2705,910" size="100,100">Leaning down to embrace Brett’s face, Alex woke him up with a wet sloppy kiss.  They frenched, Alex taking the tongue in his mouth and swallowing any spit or saliva Brett gave him. They didn’t even need to talk, both knew what had happened.  Alex swung his leg over buck, bringing their cocks to touch.  They grinded against each other, precum spreading between the two eager cocks.  Alex scooched forward, settling onto Brett’s firm abs.  He opened his mouth and let saliva drool out onto his hand.  Reaching behind him, he slicked his backside.  Alex brought his hand around, and put it under Brett’s mouth.  

“Your turn babe…”

Brett spat, and Alex moved the hand back behind him and grasped Brett’s firm and large knotted cock.  Spreading the saliva around, he lined the cock up with his cheeks.  Brett put his firm and callused hands on Alex’s hips and pushed down.  One inch, then two, then four, then six slipped inside Alex.  The final two inches would have to wait until Alex was spread enough to take the knot.  Alex started gyrating, pumping Brett in and out of him.  Brett quickly took control, bouncing Alex roughly on his member. It was hot and it was fast, the last two inches popped into Alex, and they both tensed against each other as they came.  Alex dismounted, and licked up his cum from Brett’s body.  They shared a kiss, saliva and semen mixing between their mouths.  Alex had found his ultimate boyfriend in Brett.

Dog-like features covered his body, well, her body.  Obvious breasts with long teat-like nipples sat atop her pecs, a line of similar nipples running down her furry abdomen.  A pussy had replaced his dick, and long well shaped legs flowed away from her hips, covered in fur and ending in weirdly shaped paws.  Alex could see her muzzle in the front of her vision if she focused her eyes improperly, and she brought her hand to the snout to inspect the new canine face.  Like the color of her hair as a human, she was covered in tassels of blonde fur, much longer than Buck’s short black and brown fur.  

Clearly the bond had reflected her unformed thoughts back to her.  She’d need to think of a new name, like Buck had said.  Maybe Honey? Like the color of her new coat of fur.  It was the first thing she thought of, and she’d needed to come up with one fast before she lost all thought to the feelings overtaking the bond between them.  It was time to breed.  They loved each other, and had changed each other to fulfill the feelings they had felt and shared through that bond. Heat overtook the two of them.  Honey needed pups inside her, and bad.

Rolling onto her side, Honey raised a leg back up toward her chest.  One hand clasped the leg against her, and the other one reached down to her sex.  She rubbed at it, and moaned, locking eyes with Buck.  The newly shaped dog man straddled the lower leg, and brought his knotted cock to bear against her.  Thrusting in easily, they wasted no time grinding against each other.  Buck reached a hand towards Honey’s chest, and felt the new breast flesh, teasing and pulling on one of the fat nipples there.  

“These will provide more than enough milk for our litter.” Buck said gruffly, forming human words for only the second time in his life.  

Honey moaned, and orgasmed for the first time in her new body.  She’d have many more of those in just this breeding session alone.  She’d become the perfect girlfriend for Buck, and they would be happy together for a long, long time.

When a speck of cosmic dust landed on her shoulder one sunny afternoon in the garden behind her home, it was hardly the shoulder of an angel it fell on.  The first thing this seed of corruption would change for Cynthia would be to remove her rationality, what was left of it.  How else would it change her, and who would she subsequently change?

She&#39;s fucked 100s of Johns over the years, both before and after her marriage to David.  David was sexy when he was younger, and she didn&#39;t mind fucking him along with all her side pieces.  But he&#39;d gotten fat, and they&#39;d stopped fucking as often.  He still had his close cropped beard that he’d always kept, though it was a little gray now.  There was also his great head of brown hair, always professionally cut.  She didn’t think the dad bod suited him, and she despised the gut and man tits hanging off his frame.  Some people might appreciate it, but she didn’t.  She needed someone cut and fit to enjoy herself.  

Cynthia’s appetite had only grown over the years.  After Alex was born, she was sucking cock and taking dick at least 3 times a week from someone she wasn&#39;t married to.  She’d use up a guy for a while before moving on to the next one.  Like an apex predator, with an apex pussy.  Likely an addict, but she didn’t care.  She was going to feed that appetite until it was out of control, and until she was out of control.

Alex was a good young boy and her only child.  He was growing into a fine young man, however she thought of him though.  He had a golden mop of head on his hair, just barely curly like hers.  He was thin and lithe, nearing six feet tall.  Cynthia could see him checking her out.  She certainly deserved a look or two in the clothes she was wearing.  What could she say, she liked to dress sexy and tease a boy or two.  Not usually would she do so to her own, but she was feeling herself this morning.  When had she become so corrupted?  .

Cynthia asked him what he needed, and he was quick to reply. 

“Just wanted to let you know I was going to have some friends over this afternoon.  We’ll be down at the pool if you want to join us. I know Dad will be out of the house, just didn’t want to disinclude you.” Alex said, clearly a little flustered.

She nodded to him in the mirror, and resumed putting her face together.  His eyes lingered on her body as he turned to leave the room.  She adjusted her breasts, and he pretended not to see.   Naughty boy.  Just like his mother.  Perverse thoughts filled her head as she continued to get ready for the day.  Maybe she might get a little revenge on him this afternoon.

Cynthia and Amanda’s mothers had been friends, and had slutted around together back in the day. She knew about this, because her mother had a loose mouth when she had a glass or two of wine.  She’d never told Cynthia that she knew about her sordid past, but she’d never held it against her.  She was honestly in awe.  She wished she had the confidence it would need to be that kind of type-a personality.  

Visiting every so often for a ‘girls night’, Amanda would come over and they would talk about life, have some wine and maybe do each other’s nails.  Cynthia had a way with lacquer, and Amanda appreciated the sage life advice that she’d have to offer.  One night the conversation dragged on, and so did the pours of wine.  Amanda let slip to Cynthia that she knew about her lifestyle choices when she and her mother had been single and young together.  Amanda was getting surprisingly touchy with her.  Maybe it was just the wine, or some other force exerting itself on her, but Cynthia decided to roll with it.  It had been a while since she’d fooled around with another woman.  Maybe she could impart something special here with Amanda.

First things first, she’d teach Amanda how to eat pussy.  Amanda was a cute girl, with dark black hair like her mother and a cute lithe little body to match.  She had Amanda on her back and legs in the air, pussy spread open before you could say ‘a fifth glass of wine’.  Two of her fingers were pumping in and out of Amanda’s pussy while her tongue worked her clit.

At a certain point there’s only so much pleasing Johns does for you.  Maybe he’s got a nine incher, maybe he knows how to use it. Usually they don’t.  Sometimes you need someone to fuck your shit up.  Cythnia had a good portion of the summer to herself, with David and Alex off on vacation together.  She’d use the time wisely, and what she had planned was pretty slutty, even for her.    She was jonesing for someone to claim her ass.  This was different from her usual randy attitude, there was something primal about it.  It was a true and genuine need.  

She was fingering her own ass every chance she got.  It was like an itch.  She was on all fours in her bed, hands greedily lapping at her ass every afternoon.  Toys were of no use either.  Session after session failed to please her.  No dick appointment was doing it either.  It was like all the guys she’d match were limp dicked.  No one could claim her ass the way she wanted.  

Cynthia was working at both her holes on a sunny afternoon, light dappling through the window onto the sheets next to her.  Buck came into the room, and hopped on the bed.  Buck curled up in the sun spot, ignoring Cynthia and her moans.  She couldn’t help but chuckle.  Pets could be kinda silly.  Regardless, Buck had her attention, and she spotted his sheath beneath his hind legs.  Arousal flooded through her at a naughty thought.  Maybe her need was actually animalistic in nature.

She&#39;d gotten fucked by a couple of her regulars that morning, and went to their middling dinner out that night with their cum still in her pussy.  It had made her so hot.  But when she got home, the thought of any more fun evaporated when David started undressing.  

She woke up the next morning feeling recharged and energized.  Easy dreaming. Those feelings were back, and she couldn’t wait long to satisfy them.  Fuck it, he’d been a good husband recently.  She may as well reward him. She rolled him over onto his back, and he began to rouse.  Slipping his boxers down, she slid David’s cock in her mouth and started fellating.  He moaned,  and within minutes of blowing his load down her mouth.

“Anniversary treat, babe.  Hope you enjoyed it!” She said with a smile, wiping cum from her lip.

She felt so good after that.  Almost a little bit tipsy.  Maybe she should push for more? She really should treat herself.

The feeling of his warm load coating the back of his throat, it was like she was drunk on his semen.  Drunk on the connection.  And she had to have it more of it, now.  She twirled a finger through his damp pubes.

“You down for another round David?” She asked, softly.

He nodded.  She lowered her head and took him in her mouth again.  David pressed down on the back of her head and moaned once more.  

“What’s gotten into you Cynthia? You neve-”


She slammed him home all the way down her throat and he cut off.  She bobbed up and down, working her tongue up and down, over the head and around the base.  He was fully hard again in no time.  She took him out of her mouth, and licked his balls.  Every inch.  She worked around the mane of graying pubes, taking care to love and tease every inch of his manhood. And then back to her throat.

This went on for an hour, and then two.  Three loads were in her tummy by this point.  His cock was very sensitive now, and he wanted her to stop.  

“I don’t have anything left in the tank, babe.  I’m loving this but surely you’ve had enough?” David said, fingers clawing at the sheets beside him.  

She kept sucking.  David grabbed at her head, attempting to get her to stop.  Suddenly, he felt teeth on his member.  That drew his hands away fast.  Concern grew in his eyes, taking place alongside the discomfort that was already there.  Pain soon joined, as the third hour of this suck fest drew on.  She maintained eye contact with David as she kept working the cock like it was the only thing keeping her alive.  She was unstoppable, almost not even human anymore.


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Father A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Mother - Father B" tags="" position="3044,809" size="100,100">Well, she wasn’t getting a treat here, not any more than she’d already had.  Cynthia got out of bed and moved to the shower.  She touched herself while she scrubbed, but it was an empty endeavor.  She’d need another’s touch.  But first, she had some errands to run.  She picked out a good outfit, something a little sexy but also matronly, did her makeup and was out the door.  She stopped for a coffee, and noticed how cute the young man at the drive through was.  Not her caliber man though, just an errant thought. Driving towards the mall, she realized she felt… drunk?  The load in her stomach was metabolizing, and her changing body chemistry was finding new uses for the semen.  

She swept through the mall, grabbing a number of pieces at her favorite store before heading to the changing rooms.  Inside, nausea poured through her.   Grabbing the waste paper basket in the changing room, she emptied her stomach.  So much for that latte and bagel.  Strangely, she still felt like something was in her throat.  She abandoned the items she had thought of trying on with an attendant, and headed to the bathroom.  

Now squatting over a toilet, she continued to heave.  There was something there in her throat, and she knew it.  Gagging, spitting, hacking, everything she tried failed to remove the knot in her throat.  She grabbed at it finally, feeling almost a bulge above her esophagus.  Then she felt an alien feeling, like a second tongue at the back of her throat.  She continued to massage the bulge, and felt more and more like something was unwinding, or coming clear of the obstruction.  

Cynthia opened her mouth with another gag.  Then something slid out of her mouth, above her tongue.  She felt at it, grabbed it, and tried to pull.  It wouldn’t come loose, and it felt like she was grabbing on her tongue.  But she could still feel her tongue there at the bottom of her mouth.  She grabs at her throat, trying to stop whatever is happening.  Out of her mouth came a tendril, with a mouth at the end.  It coiled around and looked at her.

Whispers bloomed in Cynthia’s head.  She’d need to feed again.  She had to keep it from getting too hungry if she wanted to stay in control.  It was time for a christening.  Maybe she should try the men’s bathroom next door.  She hoped there were more than one willing participant to be found. The mouths she felt shifting down below would also need to be fed.  They were so, so hungry.

She was running hot, almost burning up.  She needed that load, she needed him inside her.  David mewled weakly, slumped now against the pillows and sheets of their bed.  By pure force of will she kept him hard and at attention.  But she couldn’t get anything to come out, no reward for her efforts.  She drew deeply on him, trying to materialize an orgasm from him.  Pain erupted from David’s cock, but he barely showed it.  So hot.  A lump appeared in his urethra, and she used her tongue to force it up.   Something was coming out for her.  

As the lump crested out of his glans, it emptied into her mouth.  Pleasure drowned her at that moment, a pure, undiluted pleasure she’d never felt before.  David screamed, but no sound came out of his mouth.  She was on fire.  She spit the orb out into her hands.  A flawless crystal, blue with black waves through it.  Almost like a marble.  She looked up at David.  What had been David, now a lifeless husk.  She’d sucked his essesnce straight out of him.  

The next step came naturally to Cynthia.  She popped the piece of crystal into her mouth and bit down.  A gush of fluids in her mouth followed the crunch, and then she swallowed it all.  Pleasure and power flowed through her, and she was drunk on it.  The most powerful orgasm rippled through her body like a tsunami, and she trembled there on the bed for minutes recovering from it.  She directed that energy that now waited inside her very soul to her body.  Fat disappeared, wrinkles smoothed, skin tightened.  The perfect body. The heat began to emanate through her body once again as she picked up her phone and called over one of her favorite boys for another feeding.

She’d decided to go for a classic tease, and she knew she’d enjoy the group&#39;s eyes on her.   Appearing at the poolside with a towel, a bottle of suntan oil, and a spiked lemonade she let them get a good look at her.  She was rocking a black one piece that could be construed as modest but really shined at highlighting her curves.  Cynthia sat down at one of the lounge chairs beside the water, placing her towel down and her beverage on the ground next to it.  She opened the top on the bottle and ran some oil down one leg, and then the other. Cynthia took her time rubbing it in, letting her movements linger as she traced along her legs.  

Quite the sensuous show for a mother and the boys ate it up.  She could feel their eyes on her.  She heard more than one joke to Alex about how they’d like to get 5 minutes in the closet with his Mom.  She stayed out by the pool, enjoying the sun and working on her tan until Alex’s friends had their fill and took off for the day.  As Alex got out of the pool to say goodbye to his cohort, she motioned him over.

[[//It was time for her to cook dinner.//-&gt;Mother - Son B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="Mother - Son A" tags="" position="3150,807" size="100,100">“Would you be a dear and get my back? I’m afraid I can’t reach it.” She nearly purred at him. 

Alex fumbled with the bottle and then got to work, servicing his mother’s skin.  She felt flames dance across her as his touch traced along the parts of her not covered by the one piece.  She was on her stomach to let him apply the oil, and the dominant position was having quite the compounding effect.  Arousal was in the air, infecting the both of them.  A quick glance at his side revealed a tent in his trunks.  She knew she was sopping wet herself.  

Alex finished, and reached down to put the bottle back beside the lounge chair.  She stopped his hand with hers, and closed it around his fingers on the bottle’s neck.  

“Your turn, dear.”

She took the bottle from him and sat up.  Alex sat down on the edge of the chair, facing away from her.  She poured a glob of oil into her hand and began to work on his back.  He was clearly worried that she would see his hardon, so he kept his hands in his lap.  She rubbed tenderly into the strong muscles in his back.  She’d really pushed this too far.  But this was typical slut Cynthia, she’d never had any self control.


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Son A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Mother - Son B" tags="" position="3257,807" size="100,100">Cynthia ran up to her room and quickly showered and changed.  She texted Alex that she would be cooking dinner tonight and that she would appreciate it if he stayed in and ate at home.  He replied back that he was looking forward to it.  Little did he know what she had planned.

She was downstairs cooking up a storm in nothing but an apron in no time, a large glass of red wine in her hand the whole time.  A little liquid courage.  By the time she was calling Alex down for dinner, her pussy was very wet.  The course material of the apron rubbing against her nipples didn’t help.  Alex ran down the stairs, eyes bulging as he caught site of her.  Almost as much as her tits were bulging against the little apron.  

“Dinner is warming in the oven.  There’s a cold beer and some appetizers on the counter.  Be a dear and enjoy them while I get changed for dinner.” 

With that, she was up the stairs, her ass shaking behind her.  She didn’t need to turn her head to know he was staring, mouth open.  A faint and rather crass phrase of disbelief followed her up the stairs.  She’d set the table with candles, a full compliment on silverware, and her favorite placemats and napkins.  A table set for a romantic date.  Making her way up to her room, she slid into a little black dress.  No need for panties or a bra tonight.  It was a scandalous little piece, with a slit going down one leg and a very deep cut to the cleavage.  She strapped on some stiletto point heels.  A quick touch to her makeup, a check that none of her bangs were awry, and she was sauntering back down the stairs.  Alex awaited her at the counter, mouth agape and beer in hand. 


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Son B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="Mother - Son A 2" tags="" position="3151,913" size="100,100">When she finished applying the oil, he got up and took a seat on his own lounge chair next to hers.  He laid out on his stomach, and she laid back into hers.  They let the last of the day’s sun work over their skin, peacefully and quietly.  When they got up some time later, Alex gasped in surprise.  Had a tit come out of her one piece? Cynthia looked down and immediately saw that she had… changed.  Her skin was tight, her body perkier.  Fat had disappeared from her frame.  She ran inside to the hallway and looked in the first mirror she found.  Her hair was a dark auburn, her eyes green.  She was not herself.  Whoever she was, she couldn’t have been more than twenty years old.

She was checking her body out in the mirror when Alex loomed behind her.  He had his hands on her waist and was pressing against her backside.  She could feel his hardness.  What had she changed into, his ideal babe?  That had to be it.  There’d be no other way to explain his actions.  Well, she had teased the living daylights out of him.  Shit.  She better take responsibility.  She took his hands in hers, and brought them up to her chest.  He worked his fingers under the thin material of the one piece and began to massage her breasts.  She could feel his fingers working at her nipples, now hard and erect.  He was so hard against her back, pressing his member into her skin.  She reached down and around behind her to work at his swim trunks.  They were on the floor with a little effort.  

Cynthia took his hands off her tits and out from under her one piece and put them back on her waist.  She leaned forward onto the credenza the mirror sat on and looked back at him.  

“What are you waiting for? (text-colour:cyan)[[[Aren’t I your perfect fantasy baby?-&gt;Mother - Son A 3]]]”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Mother - Son A 3" tags="" position="3150,1021" size="100,100">He didn’t waste any time after that.  Roughly hooking fingers into the bottom of her suit, he pulled it aside.  His hot and hard member sunk deep inside her wetness.  He lasted quite a bit longer than she thought might be possible with the body she now had.  When he did finish, she stripped out of the suit and took him by hand to the shower.  They’d go another round in the shower.  Then they might get out of the house, go on a date.  Cynthia wanted to see how he’d treat her to a night out on the town.  

Alex took her to the movies.  It was an interesting film, she guessed, as she wasn’t paying a lick of attention to it.  Her mouth was all over his cock in the back of the theater, and she was enjoying it.  There was something perverted about sucking a load out of her own son in such a public place.  She excused herself to the bathroom, wiping the trail of cum from her lips and lickig her finger clean.  

When she got to the bathroom, she found herself appearing different yet again.  She looked… Asian?  Dark black hair, hooded eyelids, skin ever so pale.  This was yet another surprise on top of the day&#39;s events.  A toilet flushed behind her, the stall door opening.  A man came out, surprised by her appearance in the mens bathroom.  Oops.  Knowing that she could only be displaying his deepest fantasy woman, she turned towards him and pushed him into the stall.  It would only take her a couple minutes, and then she’d be back at the showing with Alex.  If she didn’t run into anyone else first.

He could barely summon up a couple of words.  She served him one course, and then a second, attending him with every action. She cleared plates, wiped a little schmutz off his cheek with a napkin, and even single handedly held down conversation.  Cynthia didn’t blame her son, he was basically putty in her hands at this point. She didn’t even know why she was really doing this anymore, this was way way past a tease.  But fuck, it felt soo good.  She’d keep pushing it.  

She came back to the table, and knelt by his chair at the head of the table.  His eyes were wide open, one hand on his lap and the other on his napkin laid down on the table.  

“It’s time for the main course.” She said innocently, then left her mouth open slightly.  

He flinched.  She thought to herself that if she had special powers she might have heard his soul leaving his body.  God, this was really something.  He was totally wrapped around her fingers, and she had complete control over this situation.  She removed his hand from his lap, and slowly drew down his fly.  Next came the button. She pulled the pants to the side.  His cock was bursting against his boxer briefs.  She reached out a hand and held it against the bulge.  He let out something between a whimper and a moan.  Cynthia pulled down the edge of his underpants slowly, teasing this out to the last second.  His cock popped free, flopping down in front of her.  Was this a tease any longer? Her mouth opened, saliva flooding in.  Just a taste.


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Son B 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="Mother - Son B 3" tags="" position="3259,1020" size="100,100">His cock went in her mouth and she was sucking longingly.  He put a hand to her hair, the need too great to restrain himself anymore.  She worked her tongue around his glans, gently lapping at her son’s member.   He thrust forward in a cute and eager manner, trapped between her head and the chair.  She popped him out of her mouth before he could finish though, she’d need him standing to attention for what came next. 

She led him up the stairs hand in hand.  Cynthia hoped her son could see she wasn’t wearing panties.  Maybe the trail of wetness tracing down her leg was a give away.  They got to his bedroom when he stalled.  She’d slipped out of her dress, her motherly body presented before him.  Would he be man enough to go all the way?  Alex stripped out of his clothes, his cock still wet from her mouth and swinging in the dark of the room.  He stepped up to her, his hardness pushing against her pubis, his hands holding her by the arms.

“I want you so bad, mother.  Please let me have you…”

Cynthia chuckled and stood on her tippy toes to kiss him on the forehead.  And then on the lips.  They melted into each other&#39;s embrace. He spun her around, sitting down onto the edge of the bed.  She climbed onto the bed after him, taking position with Akex’s cock wedged between them.  He leaned back as she took his throbbing dick in her hand and guided it towards her hungry pussy.  She started riding him, rubbing her clit against the base of his cock, enjoying his hardness inside of her.   


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//Cynthia knew she was going to get pregnant tonight.//-&gt;Mother - Son B a]]

[[//Alex would grow into their new relationship.//-&gt;Mother - Son B b]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="Mother - Son B a" tags="" position="3189,1127" size="100,100">She rode him like it was their wedding night.  Her ass was slapping against his legs, her pussy making an orchestra of lewd noises as she took him to heaven.  She leaned back, breathing heavily from exertion.  Her own son was deep in her pussy, and she’d baited him into this whole endeavor.  She was in control of this moment, this was of her own making.  Cynthia was ablaze with passion.  Orgasms rippled through her with barely any time between them.  Sweat beaded on both of their bodies.  
“Mom, I’m getting close.  Your pussy, it’s…” Alex moaned as she clenched.  

“Call me Cynthia tonight.  Unless you want to come inside and make me a mommy again.  I am ovulating, afterall…” she said seductively.

At that final sentence, his hips slammed up and he moaned again, releasing deep inside.  She clenched around him, reaching one final big orgasm to cap off the night.  Cynthia rolled off of Alex, collapsing in a breathy mess next to him on the bed.  They fell asleep, arms intertwined, a loving embrace between mother and son.  

When Cynthia woke, she could tell immediately that something magical had happened.  Her belly was swollen, breasts heavy with milk.  Alex stirred against her, and woke to the same sight.  Their hands met on her stomach, feeling for signs of the baby growing quickly inside her.  Her areolas and nipples swollen to match the size of her pregnancy breasts began to leak milk.  Alex leaned forward and took a nipple in his mouth.  She smiled and held his head against her bosom.  This was a familiar feeling, and one she’d missed.  But it had a very adult underpinning to it, especially when he moved his hands to her pussy.  

Alex alternated between her breasts, giving each one attention in turn as he worked his fingers in and out of her snatch.  She was slick with arousal, and was soon trembling on his hand.  She couldn’t explain how this had happened, first the game of chicken and then this miraculous pregnancy.  But she didn’t care.  She looked down and saw her son was very hard and ready to go.  She wondered idly how long he’d keep her pregnant.  She hoped it was a long time.

They hugged as she bounced up and down on his hardness, his head between her breasts.  Arousal and passion consumed her very being, the reality of her taboo evening feeding the flames inside her soul and powering the engine of her lust.  

She was so hot, so full of life and energy.  Her pussy was the hammer, his dick a lump of iron and the bed the anvil.  This moment of intimacy she’d brought about was a forge for their souls.  They’d never be the same after this night.   She rode him with the pussy that made him.   This experience was becoming transcendental, it was like she was floating in a cloud of arousal, bumping into Alex’s soul in the fog.  

She brought his head up from between her breasts to kiss him, and she noted the coarse beard on his face.  It was brown, yet beginning to gray.  Musculature rippled under his skin, now much less smooth and quite hairy.   She wagered the cock inside her didn’t just feel bigger.  Alex had been reforged in the fire of their passion, a perfect soulmate for a needy mother.  They came together, like a lock and key unlocking their future together.

“You taste just like your mother.  So sweet tasting.  This reminds me of the old days.  What a trip!”

Amanda quivered, a mini orgasm shocking through her.  When she snapped to, Cynthia looked up from her pussy.  Age seemed to be draining from her face as she liked the pussy juice off her lips.  Cynthia kept working her fingers inside Amanda, keeping her whimpering and ready for her next taste.  

&quot;You even look just like her.  This really brings me back, Amanda.  I feel like a young woman again.  I&#39;m almost tempted to go get on a slinky little clubbing outfit and maybe we could go out, just the two of us.&quot; 

Amanda put her head back down between Cynthia&#39;s young and soft legs, licking like a pro.  She knew just what buttons to push, where to lick and how much pressure to apply with her fingers at the right time.  It was all too much, and Amanda was coming on her face again in no time.  In the haze of her second orgasm, Amanda witnessed the age disappear from Cynthia&#39;s face again.  She reckoned they might be around the same age now, early twenties and at their prime.  Cynthia&#39;s younger body was erotic to say the least, and Amanda couldn’t help but admire it.  Neither could explain what was happening, but they discussed it and figured that the best course of action was just to enjoy the night and see what happened. 


(text-colour:lime)[[[//It&#39;s a perfect night to go clubbing.//-&gt;Mother - Tutor A]]

[[//Cynthia was seriously hot.  Amanda had to have her.//-&gt;Mother - Tutor B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="Mother - Tutor A" tags="" position="3369,806" size="100,100">Cynthia certainly was feeling the full effect of her returned youth.  Swiping open her phone, she went straight to camera mode and started snapping selfies.  She got one posing between Amanda&#39;s legs, just for her private collection.  She had always known she was hot when she was younger, but seeing again in person after all of these years was something else.  

Amanda looked at her own, and saw a notification pushed through.  An event at a club downtown, a DJ she liked was doing a set. She tapped her finger to her lip and thought about what Cynthia had said.  She showed her the invitation, and they looked at each other and nodded.  It was time to go out.  They gathered their clothes and were out the door to Amanda’s apartment.  She’d have a couple of outfits they could pick from, and a little cheap booze to drink while they got ready.

At the apartment, Amanda pulled out a rack of clothes from her closet.  Cynthia walked up and picked up a slinky blue sequined dress, very short cut with spaghetti straps.  Amanda selected her own, a red jumpsuit of a rather sheer material that consisted of a halter top and bottoms that revealed more leg than they covered–a slit ran down the outside of both legs.  Pumps to match for both of them, a little makeup, and a couple shots for the both of them.  They were quite the sight as they went down the street into the city center, wooing and laughing, on their way to the club.

Confidence has bloomed within Amanda, turned on by the sight of Cynthia’s new body.   Cynthia had always considered herself gal pals with Amanda’s mother, ones that could mess around.  But never really more than a tease here or a lick there.  And she didn’t take Amanda for a lesbian, either.  Whatever was allowing her to change in the moment must also be altering Amanda in some way.  She didn’t really need to know what was happening, though, all she had to do was go with the feelings of pleasure being generated.

Amanda took her head in her hands as she lowered her mouth back down.  Grinding on her face, Amanda was quickly taking charge of things.  Cynthia didn’t mind, this was something new for her and she was enjoying it.  Amanda luxuriated while Cynthia worked on her lower lips, reaching into her bag for her phone and a hair tie.  She put her phone in her lap while she put her dark black hair up in a ponytail.  The look suited her, like she was getting ready to tackle something.  Cynthia realized that something was herself.  One of Amanda’s hands picked up her phone, the other snaking around to the base of Cynthia’s head and pushed her down.


(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Tutor B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="Mother - Tutor A 2" tags="" position="3369,913" size="100,100">They weren’t in the line for long before they got to the front.  Embarrassingly, they ran into Alex and one of his friends inside.  Alex gave Cynthia quite the look over, but didn’t seem to recognize her.  Amanda introduced her as Cindy.  Alex’s friend was quite the hunk, and she took to him very quickly.  Finding a moment to pull Amanda aside, Cynthia gave her a little pep talk.  After a few more drinks and some grinding on the dance floor, they should take Alex and his friend back to their apartment.  She’d take the friend and Amanda should take Alex.  They were so cute together, after all.  With that, the plan was set.

Cynthia loved to dance, and the way these young ones were dancing these days was something else.  She could really get into it.  House beats bounded through the dance floor, the rhythmic bass getting her into the moment.  Grinding against Alex’s friend, who’s name she had already forgotten, she enjoyed the feeling of his bulge through his slacks.  Her dress was scandalously short, barely covering her ass.  She could feel it trying to ride up, her legs long and silky smooth completely exposed on the dance floor.  She’d enjoy this young one later this evening, savoring him like a treat.  Her body swayed to the music, the youthfulness of the experience charging her up and arousal blossoming inside her.  Glancing over the dance floor, she could spy Amanda and her thin and cute little body grinding against her son Alex, his hands on her waist as they danced.  A perfect match.  She was glad she’d been able to give them a little push through these weird circumstances she’d found herself in.

Speaking of a little push, the guy she was dancing with was starting to get handsy.  She pulled his hands to a stop and leaned in to yell in his ear over the music.


(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Tutor A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Mother - Tutor A 3" tags="" position="3369,1019" size="100,100">“Don’t get too fresh with me until we get back to Amanda’s and I&#39;ll let you nut on my face.&quot;

That got him to slow things down.  For now, they danced and enjoyed the feel of each other&#39;s bodies and the music. 

Amanda and Cynthia had the two boys eating out of their palms by the time they were climbing out of their rideshare back at Amanda&#39;s apartment.  Cynthia was pretty sure Amanda had let Alex finger her during the ride back, but they had been fairly low key about it.  The only indicator was how breathy Amanda had gotten at one point.  Cynthia however, had kept her hand on the other boys thigh the whole ride back, not even trying to hide her teasing of him when she curled her fingers and prodded as his hardening bulge.  Poor boy, but she&#39;d make it up to him.  They staggered inside the apartment, all four of them making it to the bedroom. 

Amanda had her halter top unstrung and her perky cute little breasts out, Alex massaging at them as they embraced and kissed.  Cynthia simply discarded her little blue dress in a single move, amazing her captive audience as he tried to get undressed as quickly as possible.  Both girls sat down on the bed, each with their legs spread and one hand on their pussy.  Their other hands were held together between them resting on the sheets as the two boys approached, cocks out.  They’d only need their mouths for the next bit, and Cynthia felt like Amanda would want the reassurance while they took this to the next step.

Occasionally she’d look up and see Amanda looking at the phone intently, biting her lower lip.  The phone seemed normal, until she realized there was a red light reflecting in Amanda’s eyes.  She was filming.  Naughty girl.  Cynthia sucked down firmly on Amanda’s clit, and the girl trembled with orgasm.  
Unclenching her thighs from Cythia’s face, Amanda got up, still holding the phone as she drew away from the couch.  It was always pointed at Cynthia.  She looked quizzically at Amanda, who then spoke.  

“Just giving everyone a good view of your slutty little body.  Say hi to the stream!”

Cynthia’s stomach dropped.  This wasn’t a cheeky video for Amanda’s spank bank, this was some sort of live broadcast.  Her hand went to her mouth and she wiped the pussy juice off her chin.  Then she touched up her hair.  Amanda stepped closer and pointed the phone at her breasts. One of Amanda’s hands went out and grabbed at her titty, twisting gently on her nipple and pulling at her boobflesh. 

(text-colour:lime)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Tutor B 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="Mother - Tutor B 3" tags="" position="3474,1018" size="100,100">“Perfect, with your arms up in the air these puppies are swinging about really nicely.  What are they, 36E cup?”

“36D, but close.  Um, how many people are watching?” Cynthia asked quietly.

“About three hundred and fifty.  I usually only cop about half of that when I do a solo masturbation stream, but with your face and my pussy in the thumbnail I’m attracting a lot more traffic than usual.  Tell the viewers your name? They’re all excited to meet my new girlfriend.”

Cynthia froze like a deer in the headlights.  

“Rose.” she said, blushing.

“Well Rose, say goodbye for now.  The next time I go live, you all will enjoy what I have planned! Later, and have a good night everyone! Byeee!”

Amanda clicked off her screen and threw the phone down on the couch.  She walked back up to Cynthia and put her hand on her cheek, stroking it gently.  Cynthia knew she’d not be returning to her own life again.  She’d be Rose from now on, and she better pack a bag before she went home with her Mistress tonight.  Not that much of her middle aged woman’s wardrobe would really work anymore.  It was time for something new!

She took a glob and applied it to her already stretched hole, spreading it around and deeply inside her.  Cynthia then reached over and stoked at her dog’s hind leg.  Moving her hand down to Buck’s belly, she began to rub at his sheath.  Buck roused from his slumber, turning his head quizzically at her.  She kept stroking.  

Buck’s cock slid out of his sheath slowly but surely.  She took another glob of lube and applied it, spreading it from the pointed tip all the way to the knot at the base.  Buck was standing now, panting with his tongue lolling out of his mouth while she stroked at him.  

“Come here boy.” She said, slapping at her ass.  She had her legs folded towards her chest, spread open and her asshole presented.  Buck plodded around and sniffed at her waiting hole.  Buck then moved forward, putting his front paws underneath her arms and moving his cock into position.  Cynthia grabbed at it, lined it up, and grabbed Buck by the haunches.  He started rutting.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//Ouch! Too much too fast.//-&gt;Mother - Dog A]]]

(text-colour:red)[[[//Buck’s just what she needed.//-&gt;Mother - Dog B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="116" name="Mother - Dog A" tags="" position="3605,803" size="100,100">It was a lot, and a lot much too quickly.  Pain lanced through her pucker and she twisted away from Buck. The dog pulled off her, sensing that something was wrong.  His cock was simply too big to start ramming like that.  She sprinted to the bathroom, holding her behind and wincing.  

Getting in the shower, she cleaned up and emptied any remaining trace of Buck from her behind.  She had sobered up in the shower, the passion of the moment and the out of control desire leaving her mind as she cleaned.  Things went back to normal for Cynthia after that.  Days went by, without the extra desire to please her ass.  Then weeks, and then a month had lapsed.  That was when she noticed her nails.  

They’d become claw-like, thicker and longer with a heavy point to them. Her fingertips began to thicken, almost like pads.  But the thing that really had Cynthia freaked out, was the itch returned.  Nay, she was in heat.  Buck stayed by her side constantly, always sniffing at her and baying.  He was ready to claim her.  She considered going back to her fingers and toys routine, but she didn’t dare with her newly developed claws.  

Buck became more aggressive with her as she continued changing.  Her ears ascended on her head, becoming hairy and flapped down, exactly like a rottweiler.  A short tail sprouted from her backside, just between the dimples in her lower back.  Her feet changed the same as her hands, becoming almost useless as their dexterity disappeared.  The last thing to change for her body was a coat of fur that grew in, covering her from paw to knee and to her elbows.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Dog A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="Mother - Dog B" tags="" position="3714,805" size="100,100">Buck was pounding away at her, barking happily.  The mix of pleasure and pain was something she’d never felt before.  Or at least not since she’d been double penetrated in her ass at a gang bang a number of years ago.  Minutes crawled by as she focused on the full feeling.  She could feel the ridges and curves to his cock as he plugged away.  The ass is full of nerves, after all.  

Cythia was completely relaxed after a while, and she could feel her orgasm building.  His knot teased at her hole, pushing and teasing against her tightness.  One particularly good push, and Buck popped it in.  Orgasm crashed down around her.  His seed began to jet inside her.  Cynthia focused again on the feeling of being full, and chained together another orgasm.  Pleasure rippled through her as she trembled against the impressive member pushing fluid into her deepest recesses.  

Buck eventually deflated and then untied her.  She immediately noticed the empty feeling as he pulled away.  Putting her hand at her backdoor to stop the flow of cum from making too much of a mess on her nice bedsheets, she walked off towards the bathroom.  Her hole felt slick, and her hand almost bounced off it as she walked.  Getting in the shower, she began to clean herself out.  Cynthia noticed that her fingers went inside her with ease, though she brushed it off as still being stretched out.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//...//-&gt;Mother - Dog B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="Mother - Dog A 2" tags="" position="3605,909" size="100,100">Cynthia’s body wasn’t the only thing that would change.  The heat ate at her, consuming what was left of her.  She couldn’t stand it, gnawing at her like a dog trapped inside her soul trying to get out.  Finally, she had to relent and feed that craving.  She got on her bed on all fours, front paws down and rear paws facing upwards, her pink toe beans wriggling with anticipation.  Buck was there as always, waiting for the opportunity that had just come knocking.  He wasted no time, lept up atop her and was mounting her right away.  

She felt her asshole relax as his rod rubbed between her cheeks.  Cynthia arched her back and pulled her knees together under her, revealing her pink holes.  Buck knew which one to fill though, ignoring her pussy to enter her ass.  He drove home, rutting away.  The pleasure completed Cynthia, and she was riding waves of orgasms soon enough.  They barraged at her mind as Buck barraged at her backside, each little orgasm chipping away at any humanity she had left.  By the time Buck’s knot was inside her, she was drooling like a dog, her brain nearly empty and useless.  

All she could summon verbally when her owners got home was a series of barks and growls.  She hoped they could understand what she needed.  What had been Cynthia licked at their hands, not understanding the confusion they displayed. Maybe if she got on all fours and presented like she did with her alpha, David and Alex might use her holes as well.

Strappy heeled sandals, a little make up, and she was out of the door. Cynthia spent the rest of the day out running errands, making sure to pick up a new bottle of lube at the pharmacy.  The thought of what she’d be using the lube for had her wet within seconds.  But she realized it wasn’t her pussy that felt wet.  It was her asshole.  She could feel it, like a ring of flesh, grinding against the thin strip of her thong and just oozing wetness.  Panic welled in her as she thought she might be having some residual issues from her rough fucking earlier.  She hurried to the front counter and asked for the key to the bathroom.  Rushing inside, she began to wipe at her behind. 

Immediately she noticed that the texture and shape of her hole had changed.  It was like a donut, swelled and bouncy with the pucker at the center.  She brought away the wipe and found it was clear, and smelled of pussy.  She flushed.  This wasn’t leftover lube, or dog cum making its way out of her lower intestines.  Her ass, her donut, was wet with arousal.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//She’s made for Buck.//-&gt;Mother - Dog B a]]

[[//Buck’s got a new toy.//-&gt;Mother - Dog B b]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="Mother - Dog B a" tags="" position="3653,1018" size="100,100">Cynthia buried her thongs deep in her chest of drawers over the next couple of days.  She wouldn’t be able to wear them for a while, at least.  Once this thing with her ass went away she’d be back to them.  They rubbed up against her asshole too much for her to feasibly wear them. If she did, she’d collapse in a puddle of fluids five steps out of the closet.  So she went commando, because there was no way she was wearing anything less sexy.  But that didn’t really matter, because just simple actions like getting up or sitting down, activities like cleaning around the house or even just driving around was too much.  The rumble from the engine and the road vibrated straight through to her overly sensitive donut of an butthole.  

When the heat came, nothing else mattered.  She’d rub her pussy, knead at her breasts.  She’d binge through guys, but they weren’t any help.  Even if they used her ass it didn’t compete with the feeling of Buck deep inside her.  After a few days of trying to ignore what she needed, it was too much to handle.  She drove home from her yoga class on a mission.  The poses she’d been holding during class had driven her up the wall with an aching need.  Any flex or tensing of a muscle sent a signal straight to her asshole.  It was practically twitching by the time she was on Buck’s doggy bed with her clothes off and her donut presented.  

Buck wasted no time when he sauntered into the room and found her.  A quick hello sniff and lick and Buck had his paws on her back and his cock swinging from his sheath.  She nearly screamed from pleasure when he plunged inside of her.  She didn’t need any lube or prep, Buck just slid right in.  His knot went in straight away, her hole not offering any resistance.  Buck was pounding away at her, the knot pulling in and out as the length of his dick was pulled in and out of her with a dog’s speed.  

She orgasmed straight away, her pussy squirting as she lost full control of her body.  Urine and pussy juice flooded Buck’s doggy bed.  She half moaned and half sobbed as tears came to her eyes.  She moved her hands to her eyes to wipe them clear and buried her head in them as the shame of it all set in.  She was completely ruined, and she had no idea how she’d hide this from her family when they returned.  She was Buck’s anal toy now and forever.

Maybe even claim her.  She could feel her lust rising to uncontrollable levels at the thought of becoming Buck’s.  She attempted to calm the storm raging inside of her by focusing on the feelings of Buck plowing away at her.  She could feel every inch of his doghood, thrusting in and out of her.  His pacing was untouchable, it was like a hypnotist working at her.  

Her thoughts began to slow.  There was only pleasure.  She barely was even moving, just focused deeply on the sensual.  Cynthia could feel Buck growing inside of her.  Orgasm was coming.  She curled her fingers and her toes in response to the feeling, or at least she tried to.  Panicking, she realized she couldn’t feel them.  She couldn’t even move her arms or legs.  She was paralyzed, except for her eyes.  Orgasm took her, and she blacked out.

Buck hadn’t been getting bigger.  She’d been getting smaller.  Her limbs had withered and atrophied, and then simply crumbled to dust.  Her ass turned to silicone first, and then it spread down her abdomen and back towards her head.  But she didn’t know this, she had been drunk on pleasure, too focused on it to feel what was happening to her body.  As the wave of silicon moved to her neck, her torso began to shrink, becoming more compact and of a less than human size.  The wave of silicon had washed over her head as the orgasm hit.  She hadn’t blacked out, she’d ceased to exist.  Buck finished inside the silicon toy, pumped his load deep inside, and then untied as his knot deflated.  Jumping off the bed, leaving a trail of dog cum, he left the room.  David would find the strange masturbation aid, well used, when he returned from vacation.  How it got there, and how the fake head on it looked like his wife, he didn’t know.  But the open mouth on the end did look inviting.

She’d moved back to her home city for it, having done four years of undergrad in another state.  Being close to home, even if her parents had moved to sunnier climes, was nice.  Amanda could visit her old family friends the Kalems, as well as pick up some part time work tutoring Alex, her old childhood friend.  She was over at their house, taking an amble through the backyard the day a cosmic entity brushed against her.  Taking stock of her character and her desires, it immediately catalyzed.  A part of her mixed with the seed, and distilled into a worm, a parasite.  An engine for change, buried deep inside her. Where would she start her hive?

She could change her body, and produce engines for change.  She was aware that she had a certain growth capacity, and the pace that she could infest others.  My, that was a fun thought.  She couldn’t wait.

But how did she want to manifest it? And what, or whom did she want to control with it? It was time to secure a platform for her new species.  She wasn’t human anymore.  At least she didn’t feel like it.  Amanda was still presenting as human, she hadn’t made any drastic changes to her body chemistry or appearance.  

She’d start with David, he’d give her access to wealth and he would be easy to seduce.  First, she’d need to develop more attractive secondary characteristics if she wanted an easy time with David.  He was a kind, older man, and she’d always valued her relationship with him.  He’d be easy to exploit.  David’s overweight body and graying hair meant she’d have no competition, either from his wife or from other potential suitors.  She liked his body, however much it wasn’t appreciated by this society.  Plenty of mass for transformation and useful for plenty of activities.  

She focused her mind, and set the seed to change her breasts.  They grew, expanding to a more moderate size.  Her nipples ballooned, her areolas growing.  Fat nipples sat atop perky breasts that shot straight out of her chest, barely any sag to them.  She swayed on her heels, and flicked at her nipples.  They bounced deliciously.  David wouldn’t be able to resist. Once he saw her new tits, he was clearly enchanted by them.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Father 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="Tutor - Mother" tags="" position="4282,465" size="100,100">Amanda got it in her newly formed mind that she wanted to birth a new species.  She’d need a queen, someone two produce infection platforms for her.  It would be busy work, and not something she wanted to use her primary form for.  That would be required to orchestrate other needs of the hive.  That sounded like a nice fulfilling goal, leading a hive.  It was time to lay the groundwork, and she’d start with Cynthia.  

She knew Cynthia for a long time, having been over to their house to visit as a child with her parents, and now as a young adult to help mentor her son Alex before he left for school.  Amanda had always thought of Cynthia as basically an Aunt, so she thought that Cynthia deserved  better than being any old seed bed.  She texted Cynthia, and set up a girl’s night in.  A few glasses of wine and a raunchy romcom later, and they were both dozing on the couch.  Amanda was only pretending, however, truly a predator waiting.  

She moved her hand to the band of her short shorts, slipping it below and towards her pussy.  She worked her lips open, diving between her labia and pulling forth a small infection platform.  It was tiny, just a little worm to get things started.  She’d modified one of her ovaries to produce this, and it was the beginning of her new race.  Amanda brought it to bear, putting her hand beside Cynthia’s head and whispered a command to the worm.  It wriggled off her hand, landing on Cynthia’s cheek.  It searched around, looking for an opening.  It found Cynthia’s closed eye, as she was still slumbering peacefully.  It wormed its way under the eyelid, and made it’s way into her skull behind the eye. 


(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Mother 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="125" name="Tutor - Son" tags="" position="4514,473" size="100,100">Amanda knew that Alex was going through some discernment.  She felt empathy for him, as she was also going through some changes and had to make decisions on how she wanted to channel those changes. They’d always been friends, even keeping touch when she went off to college.  Now she was back, and he was heading off.  Was he ready for college? Maybe, but if he wanted to go to college and be who he wanted, he might need a little push.  She’d seen a fish tail coming out of the top of his pants at their hangouts, and had seen dildo’s left out on his bathroom counter.  

Alex was a cute boy, a mess of blonde hair atop his head, and a cute toned body befitting a young adult.  He was clearly a bisexual mess, and unsure how to proceed with his life.  She knew this because he always had eyes for her, it was obvious how hot he was for her.  She had never had the most buxom of bodies, but Alex was clearly into whatever she was rocking. Amanda figured that she could spend the summer helping him discover some things about himself, and maybe he could help her figure some things out about herself in return.   

Amanda asked Alex out for a cup of coffee, hoping that they could have a frank conversation.  They met, closeted away in a little booth at a local place.  It was the perfect place to talk.  Amanda put her hand on Alex’s, and asked him if he had anything he wanted to tell her.  She looked at him knowingly, and did her best to be encouraging.  


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="Tutor - Dog" tags="" position="4844,470" size="100,100">Amanda had identified that she wanted to start her experiments with what she could create and control at her family friend&#39;s house, it was a safe space that she could manipulate and change without too many prying eyes, and it was familiar territory.  It seemed like a safe bet.  She drew up plans in her mind for what she&#39;d get started with.  She came over on the excuse to engage Alex in a tutoring session, during the middle of which she excused herself to the bathroom.  Closing the door and lowering the lid to the toilet, she sat down and closed her eyes.  This first experiment would take a lot of concentration. 

She thought of herself as a vessel, and the seed of corruption that had manifested in her core as the driver.  Her essence poured out of her body, the husky, and into that vessel.  Going limp, Amanda&#39;s mouth opened wide and a fat worm-like creature snaked its way out of her mouth.  It dropped to the floor, or rather, Amanda dropped to the floor.  This form would be perfect for a rapid colonization, she had planned to use it to control Cynthia&#39;s body for the afternoon.  She&#39;d probably rape Alex with it, and then return to her own body and observe the fallout.  

Slimy and agile, and relatively small, Amanda traveled across the room to the door and slipped under the crack.  She made her way down the hallways along the edge of the floor by the wall.  She had almost made it to Cynthia out in the living room, where she was no doubt enjoying a crisp afternoon glass of rose, when something picked her up off the floor. Buck had her firmly in his mouth as he walked back down the hallway.

David waved her over.  In her racerback tank, her tits jumped up and down as she trotted over.  Who needed a sports bra? Humans, probably.  But not Amanda.  She came up to the gate and leaned over the fence, cleavage hanging in front of David’s eyes.  Her yoga pants were high rise and showed off her ass nicely.  She was quite the sight for David. All it took was a little giggle, a brush of her hand against his arm and a look before she was inside with him.  

David offered her a drink, and she let a little of the ice cold water dribble down her chin and hit her chest.  

“Oops.” She said, as she slowly wiped it up with her finger.  

David’s eyes were glued to her chest.  She could see his cock tenting in his pants.  The poor boy was being teased like no other, and she surmised that he was desperate considering what she’d seen of his relationship with Cynthia these days.  She curled a hand under her workout top and pulled it up slowly, bunching the material under her breasts.  Amanda pulled up roughly, watching his eyes track the action.  Her tits first pulled up, then flopped down as they broke free of their cage.  Her nipples, thick with arousal, hung from her tits like erasers.

“Want something to drink?” She asked him coyly.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//She fed him until he was full.//-&gt;Tutor - Father A]]

[[//Her tits were a nice distraction.//-&gt;Tutor - Father B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="Tutor - Father A" tags="" position="3863,693" size="100,100">David wasted no time in getting his mouth around one of those fat nipples.  She expected a little more resistance out of him, but she couldn’t complain.  Amanda sent a signal to her body, and a trickle of fluid began to exit the nipple.  Not enough that David would notice, but enough to make him passive and receptive to what was about to happen.   Minutes dragged on as he tongued at her titties.  He worked one nipple in particular with his mouth, his hand moving to massage the unoccupied one.  Amanda widened her nipple, letting it open more and more as time went on.  David became quite passive, and suggestible as the aprhodisiac she was producing began to take effect.  

She cooed as he continued to suckle, running her hands through his hair.  Her nipple was now quite wide, and stretching his mouth open fully.  She felt a slither under her skin.  Willing the object out, it peeked its head through. A slug looking creature exited into David’s waiting mouth.  Her nipple shrank in size after pushing it out, no longer needing to be so obscenely fat.  She could feel the creature inside of him, traveling deep into his throat and then down his esophagus.   It stopped its journey in his stomach, fusing to the tissue it found there.  Davdi’s fingers that were working her other nipple were slick with fluid, and Amanda popped him off the first teat and moved him over.   

Another wiggle under her skin as her nipple opened wide to let out the creature.  This one went on a little bit longer of a journey.  It entered his soft palate, and then came out of his nose.  She gave it a little knowing look, and she nodded back towards its mouth.  It joined its brother and helped to colonize the stomach.  She could feel a weak signal coming from them, and through that signal a connection to David.  The awareness sat at the back of her mind.  David began to rouse from his stupor.  Dropping her shirt and giving David a kiss on the lips, she then peeled away from him.


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Father A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="Tutor - Father B" tags="" position="4019,693" size="100,100">David went after her tits with abandon.  What a horny boy.  David clearly hasn’t gotten any in a while.  While he sucked and licked to his heart’s delight, Amanda worked a hand down to his thighs, rubbing against his bulge.  She worked the button out of its clasp and then undid the zipper, pulling his hardening member out of his underpants.  He seemed fine with this development.  David made eye contact with her from between her breasts, one hand on each as she began to stroke him up and down.

David’s cock began to leak, precum welling up at the arousal from the stimulation.  Her hand slicked as she continued pumping.  But that wasn’t the only source of lubrication.  She opened a slit in her palm, and a trickle of desentizing aphrodisiac filtered out.  She wanted him drunk on arousal, but she also didn’t want him noticing that his cock would soon be fucking the hand pussy she’d made.  The chemical mix was potent, and absorbed into his skin quickly.  

David began to buck against her hand, as his member unwittingly slipped into her orifice.  She whispers in his ear that he should cum for her.  Thrusting forward with desperate need, he released his load. As the last of the seed pumped out of him, a small orgasism made its way up his desentized dick hole.  She cooed as he continued his weak ministrations, grabbing a towel from the counter beside her to wipe off her hand.  

She left him in his house, out of breath and overcome by the event.  He’d be grappling with feelings of guilt and shame as it set in that he had cheated on his wife, but he’d get over it.  When his cock would become engorged and swollen, he’d search her out for relief.  Only she had the goods to deal with his new problem.

She chuckled, and reached a hand towards his pants.  Frozen in a moment of panic thinking she intended to take this further, David didn’t protest when she reached around him to his back pocket and removed the wallet she found waiting there.  Opening it, she took out a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  

“See you next week” she said as she sauntered out the front door to continue her run.  

Amanda felt that awareness as she jogged away, she felt it when she got home, and she continued to feel it all of the week until it was time for her to feed David again.  Week by week, she found opportunities to run into David and continue her colonization.  The slugs, two at a time, found new homes in different organs and parts of his body.  His wallet ran lighter every time, his desire for her and her tits leading to him carrying more and more cash.  He was willing to make a trade.  But he didn’t realize he was trading away more than his cash.  


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Father A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="Tutor - Father A 3" tags="" position="3862,911" size="100,100">After a couple of months, the awareness of David had grown and grown in the back of her mind.  She could feel his entire body, except for his head.  It was time for the final push.  Finding David at his office, she was called in to see him.  His secretary might have had some idea of what he was meeting a young woman in his office, but she didn’t have the full picture.   She unbuttoned her blouse and he came right to suckle.  She’d trained his body well for her fluids.  Completely intoxicated, David didn’t protest at all as the first slug slithered out of her teat.  It went into his mouth, and then up through the soft palate.  Into his naval cavity it went, burrowing deep until it found the spinal cord at the base of David’s brain.

Fusing with the bone and flesh, Amanda began to feel control over David’s body.  Without using her hands or her voice, she moved him using his own nervous system to place his head near the second breast.  The slug popped out on its own, latching onto his cheek.  It trailed around towards his ear.  It slipped in, no doubt breaking his ear drum on its way inside.  David’s body spasmed as it worked its way into his skull.  She could feel it wriggling around his gray matter, before it plunged into the center of his brain and began its colonization.  

There was about a five minute window where she could feel David’s mind inside her own.  His personality, memories, his very soul was on display for her to interact with.  As the slug continued its work, piece by piece David disappeared, pieces of his mind folding into hers.  After that window of time, only Amanda remained.  Her first order of business now that she was in complete control was some fun with the secondary body’s mating apparatus.  After that, she’d begin figuring out what to do with her newfound wealth.

His cock was red and angry, like it had been stung by a bee.  He was visibly needy, having ushered her into the house with much speed.  

“I tried masterbating but I can’t cum, I’ve been at it for hours.  You’ve got to do that thing with your hand again, it was too good.  Fuck, I need it so bad.  Please.”

Amanda smiled, and pulled her tits out of her shirt.  It was a cute green top with a scalloped neckline.  David wasted no time in getting his pants all the way down around his ankles, his cock ready for her hand.  David began his routine of licking and sucking, giving her the attention she desired to her chest.  They repeated the process from the day before, and he was soon orgasming into her hand.  His load was definitely more viscous this time, almost like gelatin.  He went for multiple rounds though, pumping each load into or onto her hand.  

When she left, his cock had calmed down.  She told him that he needed to drink plenty of fluids to replace all the ones that she had extracted.  His relief at having dealt with his problem was palpable, and Amanda couldn’t help but smile at knowing it would be short lived. David called her the next morning, very early, and he sounded like he hadn’t slept.  This time David came to her apartment, wasting no time.  Amanda insisted when he arrived inside that she needed to get ready for the day, so he could either join her in the bathroom or wait.  Obviously, he agreed to join her.  They stripped together as she drew a bath.  David’s cock had almost doubled in size, his urethra wide and open, his balls swollen and dark.


(text-colour:blue)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Father B a 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="Tutor - Father B b" tags="" position="4077,799" size="100,100">The tiny organism that had entered him made its way down the urethra towards his prostate, where it set up residence.  She figured that she wanted to try breaking someone’s mind not through outright conquest, but by fomenting the desire for her control.  Amanda continued to engineer more excuses to see him, and they continued their playful petting.  David was becoming very amenable to her body and her desires for him, giving her increasing opportunities to mold the organism inside of him.  

Ass play was the key to reaching that infestation platform, as she needed direct access to his prostate.  She started blowing him, hoping to find an excuse to finger at his back door.  David seemed quite receptive.  With each milking, her control grew.  The organism had merged with his prostate, sending feelers to David’s nervous system and taking control of resources and energy that the body had access to.  

After a few sessions, she had the ability to remotely tantalize him.  At just a thought, a signal sent to the now inhabited prostate, she could milk him for all he was worth.  Pleasure would pour through him at her demand, and doing so when in proximity to herself, she could ensure a strong imprint on David.  Even if he resisted, his body would learn that when she grew near, his pleasure blossomed.

Almost as soon as you left it got hard again, and it feels so good to stroke.  But I’m not able to finish, you’ve got to help me.  I need to cum so fucking bad, please use your hand.  I’ll do anything.  Please, just help.”

Amanda led him to the bath by the cock, getting in herself first, sitting at the back of the tub.  She pulled him into the water, and he took a position between her legs.  A not quite so little little-spoon.  Wrapping one arm around his belly, her other reached towards his cock, swollen and waiting for her touch.  The head of it bobbed out of the water, so large that it almost looked like a toy.  She stroked the shaft a few times, slowly under the water, eliciting a groan from David.  There was no point to hiding what was happening anymore, David was too far gone with need.  Her palm opened, and she lined up the inviting hole with the head of his cock.  

“Do you want me to fuck your dick, David?” She cooed into his ear.   


[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Father B a 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="135" name="Tutor - Father B a 3" tags="" position="3971,1017" size="100,100">David nodded eagerly, moaning deeply when his dick entered her hand pussy.  She took him all the way, reaching her hand deep into the water to grab his balls, her arm fille completely by his impressively swollen member.  She could feel his balls churning.  Amanda brought her arm back up, tracing along the urethra with her finger as she drew upwards.  A glob of precum gurgled out of his wide dick hole, green in color and barely liquid. David breathed heavily, and she started rapid up and down movements with her hand, tribbing his dick with her hand.  

David began to shake as he approached orgasm.  She could imagine his eyes were rolling into the back of his head from the bliss, as his load worked its way slowly up.  She could feel it traveling along his urethra, viscous liquid loaded with beads.  When it reached his head and prepared to make its exit, Amanda pushed his cock down into the water.  What looked like frog eggs spewed out of his dick into the water, her children forming a clump at the top of the water.  His cock spilled egg after egg, the roe like orbs popping out one by one to join their brothers and sisters.  

David collapsed from the effort into her arms as the last egg made its way up.  His cock softened, but its swollen appearance didn’t change.  Now more an ovipositor than a functional dick, he’d never fuck anyone with it again.  He’d need to be fed, as he looked rather wan.  David would need strength to watch over their children while they grew into proper infestation platforms in the water of the tub.  She kissed him on the head as she got out of the water, and mulled over her plans for what to do with them when they were ready.

He couldn’t ignore the feelings of desire and neediness that he felt, and without putting it together explicitly, he knew that she would make him feel things he’d never be capable of feeling on his own.  She used her beachhead in his prostate to begin modifying his ass.  When it came time for her to fulfill David’s desires, she’d want easy access into his lewdest space.  

She inspected the changes in person, putting one finger inside him easily, then three, and then her entire hand.  She fisted into him, grabbing onto the enlarged and altered prostate and giving it a firm squeeze.  Ejaculate spewed out of his cock head, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head.  David was hers, forever.  There was no coming back from this.   Chemicals flooded his brain,  allowing the platform to continue its colonization of David.  Flesh transformed, consciousness altered.  David was David no longer, but now a sentry and a minion.  His body reappropriated his mass, turning fat into muscle and skin hardening into armor.  His cock morphed, becoming rather large and tentacle-like.  She didn’t want him to have all the fun, at least while ‘him’ lasted.  Her new soldier would bring her great pleasure, and make her conquering of the rest of the family quite easy.  He could hold his wife down while Amanda fed her as many infestation platforms as she desired.  Maybe she’d use him to deliver them, after all, that tentacle cock was as functional as it was fun.

“I must have dozed off.  Darn, I feel like I’ve got an eyelash stuck in my eye that won’t come out.” Cynthia said sleepily, as she pawed at her eye socket. 

Amanda kissed her Aunty on the forehead, wished her a goodnight, and headed for home.  Cynthia would be in for a bad night’s sleep, so she left the woman in peace.  When she got home, Amanda whispered commands to her soldier, who began its work on Cynthia.  The little infection platform made its home nestled between the gray matter of her brain folds and began its work on creating a queen.

Cynthia spent the rest of the evening getting ready for bed.  A buzzing sounded in the back of her skull, behind her eyes.  She took some painkillers, fearing she might have a headache beginning to rear its head.  Wincing, she put her head in her hands.  An intrusive thought entered her mind–she should stop taking her birth control.  But why? Cynthia didn’t want another child, and she certainly needed to be on birth control with all the men she was fooling around with behind.  She had a few years left before children wouldn’t be an option anymore.  Yet the thought hung with her, and her pussy flooded as it continued to intrude.  Old feelings grew inside her, returning her to the peak of her slutty days.  The pills went in the trash before she got in bed that night.


(text-colour:magenta)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Mother 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="Tutor - Mother 3" tags="" position="4277,693" size="100,100">Amanda knew that a queen would need a king, so she continued the transformations to her body.   She reutilized the mass from her chest, turning it into a breeding implement.  A thick tube of transformed parasite flesh hung between her legs, swinging with weight.  It connected to her uterus and the remaining parts of her ovaries, now turned into batteries that could produce more infestation platforms.  She strengthened her musculature, and increased the density of her bone mass.  Amanda had always liked her face and her hair, so she kept that mostly the same.  She transformed her feet, permanently arching them as bone pushed through her heel towards the floor.  This would give her small body a little more height, and she’d be able to compensate for the lack of balance with her enhanced form and senses.  

Continuing to send whispers to the agent inside Cynthia, she instructed her and molded her personality remotely.  Cynthia began to value the idea of bearing more children, but she also developed a new loyalty; a loyalty to the whispers that now openly drummed through her head.  After about a week of this mental terraforming, Amanda ordered Cynthia to join her new master.  Cynthia appeared shortly afterwards, getting out of her car at Amanda’s apartment.  She walked inside, took off her panties, hiked up her bodycon dress and sat down on the bed waiting quietly for her master.


(text-colour:magenta)[[[//Cynthia grows into the perfect queen.//-&gt;Tutor - Mother A]]

[[//This new species would need a matriarchy.//-&gt;Tutor - Mother B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="Tutor - Mother A" tags="" position="4203,803" size="100,100">When Amanda appeared before Cynthia, she was already hard.  Amanda extended her hand to Cynthia’s head, and thumbed open her mouth.  A tentacle descended from her soft palate, and reached out to touch its master’s hand.  Connecting with it, the feelings of union were strong and powerful between the two of them.  Cynthia was a proper thrall now, and her body and mind were ready for their pregnancy.  She’d be carrying the future of mankind, Amanda’s first born parasite child.  Cynthia reached her hand up towards Amanda’s powerful breeding tool, stroking the ribbed and bumpy flesh.  She couldn’t wait for her master to be inside her. 

Amanda finished the reunification with Cynthia’s controller and stepped back.  Cynthia spread her legs and leaned back, ready to take Amanda’s member.  There would be no need for foreplay, the pleasure would come from the fertilization and the bond between the two of them.  Amanda had always wanted to be a father, it seemed.  How else could such a drive have formed inside her?  Cynthia would make a wonderful mommy, and would relish carrying Amanda’s child.  

Cynthia took the monstrous cock with some trouble.  It was wide, long, and had a fat flared head.  It was really more of an ovipositor, and Cynthia still  had a very human pussy.  Amanda stretched her out, barely getting a few inches in.  But Cynthia would need to accommodate the member, and her body would make the necessary adjustments to please its master.  If she protested at all, the thoughts were filtered by the now permanent tendril wrapped around and connected to her brain.  Lubrication increased, and cellular changes began to alter Cynthia’s pussy.  It was soaking wet and much more relaxed, becoming slightly stretchy.  Amanda speared her deep, Cynthia’s stomach bulging as Amanda entered her uterus with ease.  A knot appeared at the base of Amanda’s dick, traveling slowly as it made its way up the shaft.  Amanda withdrew, and Cynthia trembled with joy as she felt her new purpose move its way deep inside her.  

A large egg was deposited inside of Cythia’s womb.  This egg demanded her body change to prepare it for birth.  Connections to her uterine lining were soon formed, granting access to Cynthia’s blood stream and nutrients.  Her nipples grew, forming fat milky teats.  Within days, the egg had grown, giving her a bloated pregnant look.  The worm inside her skull had grown, ecstatic at fulfilling its purpose and boldened by the connection it made with the form growing inside of it.  Tendrils had grown out of all of the orifices on her head.  Eyes, ears, nose, mouth.  She wouldn’t need any associated senses anymore, as she’d never be required to do anything close to work again, outside of her duty to birthing.  The tendrils wrapped around the top of her head and splayed outwards, forming a crown.  Perfect for a queen.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="140" name="Tutor - Mother B" tags="" position="4314,803" size="100,100">Amanda found Cynthia waiting in the room for her.  She was fresh out of the shower, and already masturbating her ovipositor cock. Her bone heels clicked on the floor as she sauntered over, and grabbed her cock in her hands. Cynthia moved forward, receiving the member into her own. She angled it upwards, towards her mouth.  This wouldn’t be a traditional pregnancy, and it would certainly be the end of Cynthia’s body.  But she should enjoy her body while it still lasted in this form, so once Amanda’s dick was affixed to her mouth, her hands dropped to her pussy and she began to touch herself.  

The ovipositor began to flood Cynthia’s body with chemicals.  Amanda pushed in deep and hard, popping Cynthia’s jaw out of its socket.  The woman should have screamed, if not for her brain waves being drowned out from the hum of the whispers bouncing around her skull.  Amanda raped her way deep into Cynthia’s throat, attempting to get the breeding tube deep enough into her throat to provide direct passage for the eggs into her stomach.  The reformed reproductive system began to eject the eggs, pumping them in one at a time.  Blissfully unaware, Amanda continued to masturbate her pussy, slick as she orgasmed and wet herself.  

Amanda pulled out of Cynthia’s throat, the jaw ruined and slack hanging down against her throat.  Maybe she’d gotten a little carried away, but complete domination meant she could do what she wanted.  Plus, the passage would need to be wide enough when her new queen was born. She put her hand around Cynthia’s face, caressing it lovingly.  She’d gone a little overboard with the mental modeling, and there wasn’t much left.  It was sad that her aunty wouldn’t be the queen, but at least she could provide one.

I think I’m bisexual, for one.  For the other? I’m terrified of going to college and the thought of making new connections with people seems… impossible.  I don’t know how I’m going to survive.”

She was blown away how forthright he was being.  She decided to just focus on those two things, and decided it best she forgot about her own revelations for now.  They talked back and forth, Amanda offering compliments to boost his confidence and advice as sage as she could muster.

“How about I show you how easy it is to make a new connection?” She said, smiling and giving Alex a look.  

They were out the door and on their way back to Alex’s place in the blink of an eye.  


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//Amanda gets a new strap on.//-&gt;Tutor - Son A]]

[[//She wanted to pick his brain on a few things.//-&gt;Tutor - Son B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="Tutor - Son A" tags="" position="4438,696" size="100,100">She let Alex take charge when they got comfortable back at his place.  She slipped her jeans off, removing her cute little black thong that she’d worn.  Alex had his member out, stroking it to get hard.  

“Don’t you want to see my tits?” She said, rubbing at her breast.  

The little bralette she had worn still let her jiggle her unassuming breasts just enough. He reached out a hand and grabbed a fistful.  Amanda took his cock in her own hands, drawing him closer.  She pulled her legs up, getting her feet on the mattress next to her, spreading her legs wide open.  All he needed to do was get it in, pump a few times until he came, and she’d have set him up for success in college.  Just this one awkward fuck and he’d be golden.  Alex pushed her torso down against the bed and rubbed his hardness against her. She was ready for him.

“Put it in Alex, I want you inside me.” She said as seductively as she could manage.

“Um… I already.. am…” He mumbled, crestfallen.  

Shit. 


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="Tutor - Son B" tags="" position="4599,695" size="100,100">Back at Amanda&#39;s house, they were on the couch making out.  Since that coffee date a few weeks ago, they&#39;d been getting hot and heavy, petting each other and testing the waters.  It was summer love, and it was fun.  They hadn&#39;t taken it to the next level, however.  Alex had her compromised, his fingers tracing over her vulva through her panties.  She moaned into his ear.  It was too much, and a mini orgasm rolled through her.  In this lost moment of control, an infestation engine unwittingly jumped from her mouth towards his nape.  It was tiny, like a flea, and it bit into his skin at the top of his neck–right at the base of his skull.

Amanda had not even realized this had happened until much later.   A few days after they had been making out, she became aware of the anchor that was connecting them.  It was like a remote organ, there on the back of his head that she could feel.  It was operating by an unknown design, as she had likely willed it into existence in a moment where she wasn&#39;t thinking straight.  As it fed from his body and gained the energy and mass resources it needed to perform its unintended actions, she began to understand the irreversible effect it would have on him.  First, it would alter his brain chemistry to stop him from fighting the changes.  Then, it would develop its primary organ.  Alex would be growing a pussy on the back of his head, a fuckhole with direct access to his brain and nervous system.  The thought made Amanda quiver in pleasure.  She&#39;d always wanted to connect with people and gain knowledge, but this would be a very erotic way to go about doing it.  She wondered if Alex ever fantasized about being fucked like this.  

As the slit formed in the back of his head on his scalp, hidden by his flowing blonde hair, he became aware of it.  But he couldn&#39;t tell if it was abnormal or wrong.  However, he could feel some innate sense that he should leave it well enough alone.  Curiosity killed the cat, as they say, and his new kitty was alluring but something he wasn&#39;t meant to deal with.   


[[//He has restraint.//-&gt;Tutor - Son B a]]

Amanda came up behind him and put her hands on his sides.  Attempting to comfort him, she made every excuse in the book, calling herself stupid and saying that it wasn’t a big deal.  She still wanted him to fuck her, and it was just an honest mistake.  Alex didn’t seem to be responsive.   She looked around the room, trying to figure out how to fix this.  Then she saw the bottle of lube sticking out of a drawer.  He liked getting fucked as well as fucking.

“Look, sex doesn’t have to be so normative.  I’m sorry I’ve embarrassed you, so can I make it up to you? I think we can have a lot of fun if you let me use one of your toys on you…” Amanda said, striding over to the drawer and pulling it out.

There was quite a collection there.  Impressive for a guy who seemed so unsure of what he wanted.  She picked out a six inch dildo, pink and relatively opaque.  It was veiny and pretty firm, something she’d consider using on herself.  Alex turned to look at her, and a smile returned to his face–even if it was faint. 

“I’d like that, I think.  Maybe I just wasn’t made to, you know…” he said, finding himself.


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="Tutor - Son A 3" tags="" position="4436,912" size="100,100">“We’ll work on it.  There’s lots of positions and things to try.  For now, I want to make it up to you.”  Amanda was back in.  Excitement swirled around inside her.  She felt a pulse from her nether regions.  They both stripped all of the way.  It was on. 

Amanda got him on all fours, and took a look at what she was working with. His four inches of hardness hung down between his legs, finely shaped and relatively hairless.  Alex’s sack was cute and tight against his body.  His ass was well shaped and plumper than any teen boys deserved to be.  He swayed, his cheeks parting with the back and forth movement.  Amanda curled her lip with excitement.  She began to feel more like a predator facing down prey.  Another pulse filtered through her nethers.  

She applied lube deftly with her fingers, spreading it between his cheeks and pressing it into him.  Alex parted fairly easily, he clearly had some practice with relaxing to let something enter him.  She wondered idly if he&#39;d ever had a dry orgasm from his ass, or if he&#39;d just been using it as an aid to reach a regular one.  If he hadn&#39;t, she hoped that she might be able to push him towards one.  She focused from her daydreaming thoughts and realized that she had been finger fucking him gently for what must have been a couple of minutes.  He was moaning sweetly against her ministrations.  What a cute little boy.


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 4]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="Tutor - Son A 4" tags="" position="4438,1018" size="100,100">Amanda withdrew her fingers and squeezed another glob of lube from the bottle into her hand, spreading it all up and down the shaft and head of the pink dildo.  She placed the head against his back door, and she felt him freeze in place.  Putting the smallest amount of pressure against it, Amanda watched as Alex took it ever so slowly into him.  The head was at it&#39;s thickest point bigger than the shaft, so once that pushed through the rest followed much quicker.  She angled it down, putting pressure against his prostate as she slid it in and out of him.  Minutes dragged on as Amanda continued to slowly rythmically fuck his ass.  She had one hand firmly grasping an ass cheek as the other worked the dildo into him. 

After about 10 minutes, Alex increased the noise he was making, mewling like a kitten as she pushed the dildo against his love button.  Orgasm washed over him and he moaned into the sheets.  Amanda pulled him into his side, slipping the toy out and embraced him, spooning against him as he came down from his orgasm.  Alex cried, overcome by the emotions of having his old childhood friend give him his first anal orgasm.  They cuddled until Alex fell asleep, and she tucked him in before departing.  

They spent the rest of the summer discovering this kind of play together, and Alex became quite the proficient pussy eater.  They didn&#39;t really incorporate Alex&#39;s cock into their love making, as it wasn&#39;t what they wanted to focus on.  Amanda thought of herself as Alex&#39;s anal mentor, and she ratcheted up her game to train him.  They shopped on craft sites together to find her a cute harness so that she could fuck him herself instead of what was more akin to mutual masturbation.  However, Amanda wasn&#39;t the only thing being trained.  As the strap on became incorporated into their play, the forgotten changes to her body took notice and reawakened. 


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 5]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="Tutor - Son A 5" tags="" position="4438,1128" size="100,100">With each session she could feel her pussy altering.  Her pleasure increased, her clit growing larger and grinding against the harness as she fucked him.  Eventually the growth became impossible to ignore, the expanded clit began to look rather cock like.  She avoided letting Alex eat her out for fear that he&#39;d discover what had happened to her.  Amanda masturbated her growing clit cock every night, feeding her appetite for the unique pleasure it brought her.  The morning off a planned session with Alex some weeks into their burgeoning relationship, Amanda woke to find that her cock had grown significantly.  It also didn&#39;t look anything like a cock, but rather more like a tentacle or a tongue.  It had a pointed tip, and increased in girth all the way to the base of her pubis.  It was probably 11&quot; when it was completely unfurled, though she immediately learned hiding it wouldn&#39;t be a problem as it could coil up and hide itself within her own pussy. 

The entire appendage was sensitive beyond her wildest imagination, and she found herself being brought to orgasm just by having it rub against her insides while it was hidden away. Amanda could only stop herself from orgasming by it if it hung free, untouched and unstimulated.  It also seemed to be quite dextrous, and she could control it&#39;s movements with relative ease.  She knew that she had to use it on Alex, that cute ass would be the perfect home for this new tentacle cock of hers.  She&#39;d really be able to make him mewl with this toy.  Amanda showered and got dressed for her dick appointment with Alex, managing to make herself cum only three or four times in the process.  She wore a cute top with a scoop neckline, and a floral patterned short skirt with sandal heels over to his house.  Amanda didn&#39;t bother with panties or a bra, and her tentacle cock folded inside her.  Driving over was a unique challenge, the vibrations from the car seat had her almost constantly orgasming.  Thinking it would be better to unfurl it for now, she drove the other half of the way there with one hand on the wheel and the other one on her cock.  By the time she got to Alex&#39;s house, she was properly drunk on pleasure.  Letting herself in, she marches straight up to Alex&#39;s room and found him inside, near-naked on the bed and tugging on a bulbous anal plug he had deep inside him.  He was wearing some cute lingerie, a strappy pink set with lots of belts and buckles.  It was something they&#39;d picked out together on the craft websites.


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 6]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="Tutor - Son A 6" tags="" position="4438,1235" size="100,100">Alex was happy to see her, and he wiggled his ass at her.  Rolling over onto all fours, he presented.

&quot;Do you mind if we play with my ass first Amanda? As you can see I&#39;m already in process here…&quot; Alex said, popping the jeweled plug out of his hole. 

Amanda sauntered up to him, her face crimson from the deep flush of arousal she was drunk on.  

&quot;Only if you let me use this new toy I got…&quot; she said breathily, picking up the harness from beside him on the bed.  &quot;It&#39;s a surprise though, you don&#39;t get to see it until it&#39;s inside of you&quot;.

Alex squired with delight.  The little butt slut was into her game. She dropped the harness down the side of her, out of sight from Alex&#39;s face down position on the bed.  Her hands went to his waist, and she grinded against him.  He&#39;d already lubed up for the plug, so she could get to work immediately.  She slipped her skirt off, and unfurled her cock out from inside her pussy.  It wirggled with anticipation, the pointed head finding its way to his bud.  It slipped in, just an inch, and she grabbed him by the garter belt.  It was gave her the firm purchase she would need to give him the rough fucking he was about to get.  


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son A 7]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="149" name="Tutor - Son A 7" tags="" position="4439,1345" size="100,100">Amanda started thrusting, and immediately was moaning in orgasm.  The tentacle cock shot deep inside Alex, spreading him out and filling him up.  He moaned himself from the pressure against his prostate.  She lost control of it, and it writhed around inside him, traveling as deeply as the eleven inches could.  She pounded away, completely lost in the pleasure.  Orgasm after orgasm pushed through her. If she had been more aware of her surroundings, she might have heard Alex protesting as the first egg traveled down her cock and into his waiting intestines.  It was a pretty large egg, so it stretched Alex to an almost painful max.  He spurted seed onto the bedsheets when it passed his prostate.  Alex couldn&#39;t turn around or unhand Amanda from his waist.  She was so strong, and the lingerie harness he was wearing gave her a good grip.  Plus, the pleasure was overcoming him. Soon the eggs were coming one after the other, keeping them both in rolling orgasm.  

When Amanda woke from her stupor, she was still holding onto Alex like a man overboard in a storm would hold onto a life raft.  Alex was unconscious on the bed beneath her, his stomach bulging from her clutch of eggs deep inside his organs.  He looked ideal with a fecund and pregnant body.  Her cock stirred, and she got in the bed with him, wrapping around towards his head.  She&#39;d need to put the next load down his throat, as it was her turn for oral after all.  Amanda orgamsed as her cock worked its way past his lips and began to spread his jaw.  She had a sad thought that he wouldn&#39;t be going to college anymore, but she knew she would take care of him.  They&#39;d have to shop for some maternity clothes for him, he&#39;d probably be happy to have an excuse to start wearing more women&#39;s clothing.  She orgasmed again, and the first egg of the second batch began to work its way up her cock and down his throat.

He was always running his hands through his hair these days, the follicles often touching sensitive skin.  Hopefully something addressed this new development in his life soon.  Alex could feel the need, the desire to reach out and caress his opening.  But he stood strong.  

Amanda made a late night stop over to Alex’s house, choosing a night where his parents would not be home.  Alex opened the door, and a signal that Amanda sent to her infestation platform filled Alex’s brain with chemicals.  He entered a dopey state, almost like a zombie, and walked with her up the stairs towards his room.  When they arrived inside, Alex sat down on the edge of the bed, his hands in his lap, waiting for orders.

Amanda slicked a finger in her mouth, and brought the hand up behind his head.  She teased at his slit, and Alex began to drool.  He would look so cute when she was fucking his brains.  She disrobed, getting out of her dress and clothing until she was completely naked.  Movement awaked deep inside her pussy, and ever so slowly a slug-like creature poked its head out of her canal.  She had designed this implement for exactly this purpose.  It wasn’t attached to her body, and it was fairly autonomous.  Amanda took Alex by the hand, and got him up off the bed.  He sat down, legs spread on the floor right in front of her.  She took his place on the bed, her crotch at perfect height with his head.  She pulled him back into her, the slug wriggling with excitement as it met the pussy slit.

He was always running his hands through his hair these days, the follicles often touching sensitive skin.  Hopefully something addressed this new development in his life soon.  Alex could feel the need, the desire to reach out and caress his opening.  He couldn’t help himself, however.

First he fingered it gently, feeling the slickness it produced as he teased at the sexual organ.  Pleasure blossomed inside him, deep inside his core.  This wasn’t the same as his penis being touched, or when he played with his prostate.  The overload of chemicals that flooded his brain when he touched it was transcendental.  When he slipped the first finger in and fingered at the canal that presumably led to his brain, he orgasmed straight away.  He came until his balls emptied, rope after rope of seed.  This was going to be fun, Alex thought to himself groggily.  


(text-colour:cyan)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Son B b 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="152" name="Tutor - Son B a 2" tags="" position="4546,912" size="100,100">The slug exited her pussy about two thirds of its length at most, about three to four inches. It teased at the slit, dipping inside of it, but always retreating.  She was using it like a penis, though she didn’t move herself to accomplish any of the thrusting.  She had to be careful with Alex, this was an extremely sensitive operation.  If she went too far, if the slug went all the way in, Alex would be gone. She wanted to tease this out, to protect him and help him grow.  But by god, fucking his brains felt so fucking good.  It was all she could do to stop the little parasite from slipping in forever.  She kept it anchored in her pussy, keeping control on her pleasure.  

Alex was having a much different experience.  The pleasure center of his brain overloaded, along with other important bodily functions, was in a near constant state of orgasm.  His bladder emptied, and so did his balls.  He shook and twitched, his head leaking fluid from arousal as his brain pussy was fucked silly.  The tiniest movement from Amanda’s slug dick sent him into a new state of being.  When they would finish the session, Alex would be forever altered.  New pathways would be formed in his brain, new feelings and thoughts taking place that would have never previously occurred to him.  

Alex began to become slowly altered by these brain fuckings.  He was more outgoing, confident.  He even came out to his parents and began to live life more openly.  When they’d meet up, sometimes he’d be crossdressing, or wearing makeup.  Just living his happy queer life.  He also as a side effect of getting his gray matter scrambled by her slug cock, was way more slutty.  But it was all a good fit for Alex, Amanda thought.  He’d be way happier at college now that he’d come out of his shell.  On the final night before his departure, Amanda was making tender love to his skull.  A thought occurred to her, and she let the slug slither all the way into his sloppy head slit.  Receiving the pilot platform in full, the organ on his head completed it’s transformations.  The slit closed up behind the slug, and the scalp on the back of his head returned to normal.  But Amanda could feel the slug inside, fucking his brains for her lovingly.  Now they could be together forever, even long distance.  She’d always be with him, in him, and teasing him throughout every single day and every single night.  She couldn’t wait for them to have fun in undergrad.

Seizing multiple times from orgasm, he had collapsed onto his bed.  This pleasure was unique and overbearing, like a drug.  And he wanted to fucking overdose on it, and it didn’t matter what it cost him.  Not thinking clearly at all, Alex opened the bedside table drawer and took out the big boy that he used on special occasions.  Six wonderful inches of vibrating plastic, this dildo was going to be the thing that ended him.  But he didn’t care.

Alex put the tip against his sopping wet head slit, and turned it on.  He almost blacked out from the sensation.  He pressed on.  One inch was in.  Alex’s mind was a tapestry of color, pleasure drowning out his sight and thought.  Two inches were in.  Alex was seizing again, legs shaking with wild abandon.  His head was empty, but it was so full.  He needed more.  Three inches.  There was only the pursuit of more left.  If he went any further, he was liable to be done for  he could feel it, his old self and body screaming at him to stop.  But the pussy was louder, and it wanted more.  

Alex pushed in the last three inches of fuckable dildo in one movement.  It would be Alex’s final action.  His life winked out.  Alex was gone.  There was only a young man, with a pussy on his head. And his life was to fuck that pussy.  By the time Amanda made it over to his house to stop what was happening, it was much too late.  She removed the dildo and stopped his hands from trying to fuck it with his fingers.  Slipping a control slug into the slit, she hoped he could be revived with her oversight.  But Alex was truly gone.  She’d have to make do with a mindless minion, a thrall addicted to having it’s skull pussy fucked hard and deep.

(text-colour:white)[[[Restart.-&gt;General Intro]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="154" name="Tutor - Dog A" tags="" position="4767,586" size="100,100">Buck seemed to be quite calm with Amanda in worm form in his mouth.  His jaw was clamped shut, however, his many canine teeth poking her rather indefensible body.  In a sudden panic, she wiggled her way down Buck’s mouth to his throat.  She&#39;d used a lot of energy in this form already, and this play for freedom used up about the last of it.  She needed to make it to the dogs head, if she wanted to wrestle control of this form.  It was at this moment as she traveled down his throat, that Buck swallowed.  

With no other choice, her form exhausted, she anchored in the stomach.  Sending feelers out, Amanda feebly connected into the dog&#39;s nervous system.  She sent signals through, attempting to brute force her way into dominance over this form.  It wasn&#39;t enough.  She could feel his body now, but didn&#39;t have enough control to take charge.  Buck continued down the hallway, arriving at the bathroom door.  The dog jumped up in the air, getting its nose under the door handle and pushing it open.  Inside, her body sat crumpled on the floor, having fallen off her seat.  Buck must feel the connection to her, they were sharing the space after all.  

Was Buck trying to return her to her body?  It was too late for that, at least for a while.  In Amanda&#39;s reduced state, she&#39;d need to bide her time and build energy reserves back up.  Buck plodded up to her empty shell and licked at her face, opening his mouth.  What a good boy.  He was giving her just the opportunity she needed to return.  She summoned you the last of her energy and attempted to detach from deep within the dog&#39;s gut.  But she couldn&#39;t, there just wasn&#39;t enough.  In that desperate attempt, she lost control of her own form. 


(text-colour:red)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Dog A 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="Tutor - Dog B" tags="" position="4912,584" size="100,100">Buck had her firmly in mouth, and she had no intention of messing with infesting such a lower life form, so she bid her time.  Buck nosed at Cynthia’s leg, and she got up to grab the leash.  It was time for Buck’s walk.  They went to the neighborhood dog park, Amanda in tow and offered as little as she could in complaint, staying pliant and flaccid in the dog’s mouth.  The first sunlight that she saw in almost an hour of being in there was the sky as Buck spat her out in the middle of the dog park.  

Dogs of all breeds were crowded around her.  She wiggled there in the grass, helpless and full of fear.  This was it.  She was done for.  They were growling, pawing at her.  She was defenseless in this form.  And then they set upon her with their mouths.  About eight of them got a bite out of her before she was gone.  The pain was significant, but she found that she was more adaptable to this situation than she thought.  She’d survive this, but not how she’d like to.  


As the dogs drew away from their huddle, each carried a part of her.  She could retain some semblance of intelligence and personality while they remained near each other, so she set to work quickly attempting to colonize the dogs before their owners took them home.  But she wasn’t able to accomplish much, except for base cellular changes to the various dog’s anatomies.  Burrowing into their brains, and strategically reforming as best as she could within them was about all she could do. Each segment merged with its dog counterpart, her abilities reduced to an augmented dog’s intelligence.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Dog B 2]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="156" name="Tutor - Dog A 2" tags="" position="4766,694" size="100,100">Having already made deep connections, the systems blew back on her.  She could feel the infestation platform slave to the dog, her own awareness shrinking. She could feel Buck continue to lick at her old body’s face, slobbering over it with abandon.  The body was still breathing at least, she could feel the air blowing on the tongue.  It looked good with dog saliva all over its face.  An odd thought. Was it hers? No, it was Bucks.  But she felt it from her own self.  Maybe she’d been slaved to the dog as well.  

Buck began to exert the infestation platform, kicking the engine into first gear.  The dog’s tongue began to expand and strengthen, becoming much more dexterous.  This body was her new home for now, so Amanda figured she should at least have a little fun.  She coaxed the changes out, using the influence she still had.  Like a guiding mentor, she altered the changes to include suckers all over the new appendage.  She could feel it run across her old body, the salt on the skin making an interestingly delicious taste.  

Buck pawed at the body’s legs, throwing them open.  The skirt she had been wearing had ridden up, exposing the panties underneath.  Buck’s tongue snaked around, finding it’s way to the edge of the cotton material.  The strong appendage had them aside quickly, and began licking up and down the vulva.  The body responded, wetness forming between the lips.  Amanda had little control over what was happening, and she didn’t like the idea of Buck using her body, but she began to doubt she’d ever return to it.  If she did manage to extricate herself from Buck, she could choose any body she wanted.  May as well have some fun with her old one.  She let herself drop into the flow of Buck’s feelings, riding the wave of excitement into bliss. Amanda extended herself across the dog’s nervous system, taking the passenger seat.  


(text-colour:red)[[[//...//-&gt;Tutor - Dog A 3]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="Tutor - Dog A 3" tags="" position="4765,802" size="100,100">Little tentacles extended from a number of the suckers on Buck’s tongue, the rest of the suckers doing what their name inferred.  The tongue tracked along, lapping at her old body’s pussy.  Amanda felt excitement at the prospect of how this tongue might feel if she still inhabited her old form.  Buck certainly felt excitement as well, the nerves in his new oral appendage were driving him wild.  The tongue slipped past her lips and into the hole, expending down the canal.  It came to rest on the cervix, and then withdrew.  The tongue plugged away, pumping in and out, bringing both of them great pleasure.  Amanda began to become lost in it, her identity eroding as the tongue continued to fuck.  Change fomented in the top of the tongue, the foremost sucker opening up to reveal a longer more agile tentacle.  Buck thrust the tongue deep, and it connected with the cervix.  The tentacle coiled around, holding on. They were anchored outside of the body’s uterus now.  

The desire to breed that Buck was generating became completely overwhelming for Amanda.  She was slave to it, like she was slave to Buck.  Tentacles exploded from the tip, crowding around the cervix and putting pressure against it, working it open like a stuck door.  They poured through, entering the uterus and heading straight for the ovaries.  The fervor, the need to implant this body with his children slammed against the last autonomy Amanda had, her intelligence dropping and diminishing, and like a piece of glass cracking she shattered into a million pieces.  These pieces were sanded down by his desire, and soon, they were one being.  

The tongue released a wave of infestation platforms, attacking at the eggs held in the ovaries.  These paired organisms spread throughout the body, each a new platform for infestation.  Amanda’s old body rapidly changed, her stomach expanding with pregnancy, her tits ballooning as they began to drip with nutrient fluid.  They removed their tongue from inside of the body and lapped at the fluid, giving them the energy they’d need as the host organism.  The abandoned body had become a seedbed, useful for its nutrients until it was used up.  New tentacles burst forth from their joined form as they left the bathroom, body still dripping nutrient fluid and leaking from the pregnancy, ready to make new seedbeds. Amanda was no more, and neither was Buck.  Together, they were something better.

Their bodies would undergo rapid changes, shifting in form and full of a hunger to consume and to breed.  That night, each of those dogs broke free from their owners&#39; homes and returned to the park.  If any poor soul was out for a late stroll and came upon that park, they’d find eight dog sized monsters congregating there.  

These monsters began a battle for dominance, each shard of Amanda having been completely absorbed.  Even with their reformation as a group, there was not enough of Amanda left to wrest control over the pack.  Now it was a battle for dominance between the new creations.  Tentacles went flying and cocks came unsheathed, the battlefield an orgy of killing and sexual violence.  One form merged with another, as dominance was established.  Eight became four, then four became two, and then after one particularly malformed and gross fucking they became one.

The behemoth took shape, barely holding together, a writhing mass of tentacles and constantly transforming dog flesh.  It had the mind and memories of Amanda, pieced back together, but not correctly.  It also had the mind and body of a dog, a pack.  It wanted to hunt, to breed, to add more members to its ranks.  A grotesque member grew from its crotch, hardened with lust and need.  The creature was now bidepal and walking away from the park.  It followed a faint trail of smells, and it identified the human Cynthia and began to follow.  Tonight it would breed the pack’s first bitch.
